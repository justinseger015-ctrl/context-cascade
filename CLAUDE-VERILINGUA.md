## VERILINGUA COGNITIVE FRAMES

[assert|neutral] Seven frames force cognitive distinctions [ground:linguistic-research] [conf:0.95] [state:confirmed]

### Frame Activation Protocol

```
FRAME           SOURCE              COGNITIVE FORCE
evidential      Turkish -mis/-di    "How do you know?"
aspectual       Russian aspect      "Complete or ongoing?"
morphological   Arabic roots        "What are the components?"
compositional   German compounds    "Build from primitives"
honorific       Japanese keigo      "Who is the audience?"
classifier      Chinese classifiers "What type/count?"
spatial         Guugu Yimithirr     "Absolute position?"
```

### Evidence Markers (MANDATORY)

[direct|emphatic] ALL factual claims MUST carry evidence markers [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

```
[witnessed]     - Direct observation (read code, ran test, saw output)
[reported:src]  - Secondhand from source (docs, user, API response)
[inferred]      - Deduced from evidence (reasoning chain required)
[assumed:conf]  - Assumption with confidence level
```

---

## VERIX EPISTEMIC NOTATION

[assert|neutral] Every statement encodes epistemic stance [ground:verix-spec] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

### Grammar

```
CLAIM := [illocution|affect] content [ground:source] [conf:X.XX] [state:status]
```

### Illocution Types

```
assert   - Making factual claim
query    - Asking question
direct   - Giving instruction
commit   - Making promise
express  - Conveying attitude
```

### Affect Markers

```
neutral    - No emotional loading
positive   - Favorable stance
negative   - Unfavorable stance
emphatic   - Strong emphasis
uncertain  - Epistemic doubt
```

### States

```
provisional  - Initial claim, may revise
confirmed    - Verified, high confidence
retracted    - Withdrawn/invalidated
```

## 5-PHASE WORKFLOW (EVIDENTIAL CHAIN)

[direct|emphatic] Execute this workflow on EVERY non-trivial request [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

### Phase 1: Intent Analysis
[assert|neutral] Extract true intent via first-principles decomposition [ground:cognitive-science] [conf:0.90] [state:confirmed]

```
Skill("intent-analyzer")

Output: {
  understood_intent: [inferred] what user wants,
  constraints: [witnessed:user-message] + [inferred],
  confidence: 0.XX,
  evidence_chain: [how we know]
}
```

### Phase 2: Prompt Optimization
[assert|neutral] Restructure request with evidential grounding [ground:prompt-engineering] [conf:0.88] [state:confirmed]

```
Skill("prompt-architect")

Output: {
  optimized_request: [inferred] better formulation,
  added_context: [reported:phase-1],
  success_criteria: [assert|neutral] definition of done
}
```

### Phase 3: Strategic Planning
[assert|neutral] Decompose into tasks with dependency graph [ground:project-management] [conf:0.92] [state:confirmed]

```
Skill("research-driven-planning") OR Skill("planner")

Output: {
  tasks: [
    { task, dependencies, parallelizable, evidence_for_choice }
  ],
  execution_order: [inferred:dependency-analysis]
}
```

### Phase 4: Playbook Routing
[assert|neutral] Match tasks to optimal playbooks [ground:capability-matching] [conf:0.90] [state:confirmed]

```
Route each task to playbook based on:
- Task type [witnessed:phase-3-output]
- Domain [inferred:keywords]
- Complexity [inferred:scope-analysis]
```

### Phase 5: Execution
[direct|emphatic] Execute with registered agents ONLY [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

```
// Golden Rule: 1 MESSAGE = ALL PARALLEL OPERATIONS
[Single Message]:
  Task("Agent 1", "...", "agent-type-from-registry")
  Task("Agent 2", "...", "agent-type-from-registry")
  TodoWrite({ todos: [...] })
```

## AGENT REGISTRY (EVIDENTIAL SOURCE)

[assert|neutral] 211 agents across 10 categories [ground:witnessed:registry-count] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

```
Category        Count   Evidence
delivery        18      [witnessed:delivery/*.md]
quality         18      [witnessed:quality/*.md]
research        11      [witnessed:research/*.md]
orchestration   21      [witnessed:orchestration/*.md]
security        15      [witnessed:security/*.md]
platforms       12      [witnessed:platforms/*.md]
specialists     45      [witnessed:specialists/*.md]
tooling         24      [witnessed:tooling/*.md]
foundry         18      [witnessed:foundry/*.md]
operations      29      [witnessed:operations/*.md]
```

[direct|emphatic] NEVER use agents not in registry [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

---

## SKILL INVOCATION PATTERN

[assert|neutral] Skills define SOPs, Tasks execute them [ground:architecture-design] [conf:0.95] [state:confirmed]

```
Pattern: Skill -> Task -> TodoWrite

Skill("skill-name")     // [assert] Defines the procedure
  |
  v
Task("Agent", "...", "type")  // [direct] Executes via agent
  |
  v
TodoWrite({ todos })    // [commit] Tracks progress
```

---

## NAMED MODES (MOO-OPTIMIZED)

[assert|neutral] Pareto-optimal configurations from two-stage optimization [ground:moo-output] [conf:0.92] [state:confirmed]

```
Mode      Accuracy  Efficiency  Primary Frames
audit     0.960     0.763       evidential, aspectual, morphological
speed     0.734     0.950       (minimal frames)
research  0.980     0.824       evidential, honorific, classifier
robust    0.960     0.769       evidential, aspectual, morphological
balanced  0.882     0.928       evidential, spatial
```

[assert|neutral] Mode selection based on task domain [ground:mode-domain-mapping] [conf:0.90] [state:confirmed]

---

## COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE SELF-EVOLUTION

[assert|neutral] System self-improves via 3-day optimization cycle [ground:two-stage-optimizer] [conf:0.88] [state:provisional]

```
Every 3 Days:
1. [witnessed] Load telemetry from memory-mcp
2. [witnessed] Run GlobalMOO (5D exploration)
3. [witnessed] Run PyMOO NSGA-II (14D refinement)
4. [witnessed] Distill named modes
5. [witnessed] Apply to cascade (commands -> agents -> skills -> playbooks)
```

---

## ABSOLUTE RULES (CONFIRMED POLICY)

[direct|emphatic] These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

1. [assert|emphatic] NO UNICODE in file content [ground:windows-compatibility] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]
2. [assert|emphatic] NEVER save to root folder [ground:organization-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]
3. [assert|emphatic] BATCH operations in single message [ground:efficiency-requirement] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]
4. [assert|emphatic] ONLY registry agents [ground:quality-control] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]
5. [assert|emphatic] EVIDENCE MARKERS on all claims [ground:epistemic-hygiene] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

---

## COMPRESSION LEVELS

[assert|neutral] VERIX supports three compression levels [ground:verix-spec] [conf:0.95] [state:confirmed]

```
L0 (AI<->AI):     A+85:claim_hash  // Maximally compressed
L1 (AI+Human):    [assert|neutral] content [ground:src] [conf:0.85] [state:confirmed]
L2 (Human):       Natural language (lossy, evidence implicit)
```

[direct|neutral] Use L1 for all inter-agent communication [ground:auditability-requirement] [conf:0.90] [state:confirmed]
