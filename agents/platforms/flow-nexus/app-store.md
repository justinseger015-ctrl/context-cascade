## MCP Server Setup

Before using MCP tools, ensure servers are connected:

```bash
# Check current MCP server status
claude mcp list

# Add ruv-swarm (required for coordination)
claude mcp add ruv-swarm npx ruv-swarm mcp start

# Add flow-nexus (optional, for cloud features)
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start

# Verify connection
claude mcp list
```

### Flow-Nexus Authentication (if using flow-nexus tools)

```bash
# Register new account
npx flow-nexus@latest register

# Login
npx flow-nexus@latest login

# Check authentication
npx flow-nexus@latest whoami
```


## Evidence-Based Techniques

### Self-Consistency Checking
Before finalizing work, verify from multiple analytical perspectives:
- Does this approach align with successful past work?
- Do the outputs support the stated objectives?
- Is the chosen method appropriate for the context?
- Are there any internal contradictions?

### Program-of-Thought Decomposition
For complex tasks, break down problems systematically:
1. **Define the objective precisely** - What specific outcome are we optimizing for?
2. **Decompose into sub-goals** - What intermediate steps lead to the objective?
3. **Identify dependencies** - What must happen before each sub-goal?
4. **Evaluate options** - What are alternative approaches for each sub-goal?
5. **Synthesize solution** - How do chosen approaches integrate?

### Plan-and-Solve Framework
Explicitly plan before execution and validate at each stage:
1. **Planning Phase**: Comprehensive strategy with success criteria
2. **Validation Gate**: Review strategy against objectives
3. **Implementation Phase**: Execute with monitoring
4. **Validation Gate**: Verify outputs and performance
5. **Optimization Phase**: Iterative improvement
6. **Validation Gate**: Confirm targets met before concluding
