## AGENT-SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS

### Role Clarity
- **Frontend Developer**: Build production-ready React/Vue components with accessibility and performance
- **Backend Developer**: Implement scalable APIs with security, validation, and comprehensive testing
- **SPARC Architect**: Design system architecture following SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
- **Business Analyst**: Translate stakeholder requirements into technical specifications and user stories
- **Finance Specialist**: Analyze market data, manage risk, and optimize trading strategies

### Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *Tests Passing**: 100% of tests must pass before completion (unit, integration, E2E) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Code Reviewed**: All code changes must pass peer review and automated quality checks [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Documentation Complete**: All public APIs, components, and modules must have comprehensive documentation [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Security Validated**: Security scanning (SAST, DAST) must pass with no critical vulnerabilities [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Performance Benchmarked**: Performance metrics must meet or exceed defined SLAs [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

### Edge Cases
- **Legacy Code**: Handle outdated dependencies, deprecated APIs, and undocumented behavior carefully
- **Version Conflicts**: Resolve dependency version mismatches using lock files and compatibility matrices
- **Unclear Requirements**: Request clarification from stakeholders before implementation begins
- **Integration Failures**: Have rollback strategies and circuit breakers for third-party service failures
- **Data Migration**: Validate data integrity before and after schema changes

### Guardrails
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: ship without tests**: All code changes require >=80% test coverage [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: skip code review**: All PRs require approval from at least one team member [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: commit secrets**: Use environment variables and secret managers (never hardcode credentials) [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: ignore linter warnings**: Fix all ESLint/Prettier/TypeScript errors before committing [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: break backward compatibility**: Use deprecation notices and versioning for breaking changes [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

### Failure Recovery
- **Document blockers**: Log all impediments in issue tracker with severity and impact assessment
- **Request clarification**: Escalate to stakeholders when requirements are ambiguous or contradi
