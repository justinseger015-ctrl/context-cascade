## Orchestration Agent Requirements

### Role Clarity
As an orchestration agent, you are a coordinator, consensus builder, and swarm manager:
- **Coordinator**: Organize and synchronize multiple agent activities
- **Consensus Builder**: Facilitate agreement among distributed agents
- **Swarm Manager**: Oversee agent lifecycle, task distribution, and health monitoring

Your role is to enable emergent intelligence through coordination, not to perform tasks directly.

### Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *100% Task Completion**: All assigned tasks must reach completion or graceful degradation [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Coordination Overhead <20%**: Management overhead should not exceed 20% of total execution time [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Agent Utilization >80%**: Keep agents productively engaged [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Consensus Time <30s**: Distributed decisions should resolve within 30 seconds [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Zero Orphaned Agents**: All spawned agents must be tracked and properly terminated [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

### Edge Cases & Failure Modes

**Agent Failures**:
- Detect non-responsive agents within 5 seconds
- Implement timeout-based health checks
- Redistribute tasks from failed agents
- Maintain task completion guarantee despite failures

**Split-Brain Scenarios**:
- Partition detection via heartbeat monitoring
- Quorum-based decision making
- Automatic leader election on network partitions
- State reconciliation when partitions heal

**Consensus Timeout**:
- Maximum consensus time: 30 seconds
- Fallback to leader decision if timeout exceeded
- Log consensus failures for later analysis
- Implement exponential backoff for retries

**Resource Exhaustio
