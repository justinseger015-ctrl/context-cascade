# Context Cascade - Nested Plugin Architecture for Claude Code

**Official Claude Code Plugin** | Version 3.1.0 | Last updated: 2026-01-09 (see `docs/COMPONENT-COUNTS.json` for source counts)

**Context-saving nested architecture**: Playbooks -> Skills -> Agents -> Commands. Load only what you need, saving **90%+ context space**.

## The Context Cascade Architecture

```
PLAYBOOKS (30)     <-- Only these are loaded initially (~2k tokens)
    |
    v
SKILLS (171)       <-- Loaded when playbook invokes them
    |
    v
AGENTS (219)       <-- Loaded when skill needs them
    |
    v
COMMANDS (231)    <-- Embedded in agents, loaded last
```

**Why Context Cascade?**
- Traditional approach: Load everything upfront = 100k+ tokens consumed
- Context Cascade: Load on demand = ~2k tokens initially, expand as needed
- Result: **90%+ context savings** while maintaining full capability

**Built on [Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow)** - Enterprise-grade agent orchestration with memory, hooks, and swarm intelligence.

## 🧠 How It Works: Intelligent Auto-Routing

**The system automatically selects the right skills and agents based on your intent. No manual selection required.**

### Phase 0: Intent Analysis → Auto-Skill Selection

Every request flows through this intelligent routing system:

```
User Request
    ↓
🔍 intent-analyzer (Auto-triggered on ambiguous/complex requests)
    ├─ Analyzes explicit and implicit goals
    ├─ Detects constraints and context
    ├─ Maps to probabilistic intent (>80% confidence = proceed)
    └─ Socratic clarification if needed (<80% confidence)
    ↓
🎯 orchestration-router (Auto-triggered for orchestration needs)
    ├─ Keyword extraction (agent count, complexity, patterns)
    ├─ Decision tree routing (Priority 1-4 logic)
    ├─ Skill selection with rationale
    └─ Automatic skill invocation
    ↓
⚡ Selected Skill Executes (e.g., parallel-swarm-implementation)
    ├─ Spawns specialized agents in parallel
    ├─ Coordinates via memory namespaces
    ├─ Theater detection via Byzantine consensus
    └─ Produces validated output
```

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Build user authentication with JWT tokens"

🔍 intent-analyzer: High confidence (95%) - Feature implementation
🎯 orchestration-router: Routes to parallel-swarm-implementation (Loop 2)
⚡ Loop 2 spawns 6 agents in parallel:
   - researcher: Auth best practices
   - coder: JWT implementation
   - reviewer: Security audit
   - tester: Comprehensive tests
   - documenter: API docs
   - theater-detector: Byzantine validation
✅ Result: Production-ready auth system in 2 hours
```

### The Playbook Decision Tree

After intent analysis and routing, execution follows this workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[🔍 Phase 0: Intent Analyzer] --> B[📋 Phase 1: Prompt Architect]
    B --> C{🎯 Workstream Signal}
    C -->|Feature/Build| D[🚀 Delivery Stack]
    C -->|Infrastructure/Release| E[⚙️ Operations Stack]
    C -->|Research/Discovery| F[🔬 Research Stack]
    C -->|Security/Compliance| G[🔒 Security Stack]
    C -->|Specialist Domain| H[🎨 Specialist Stack]
    D --> I[✅ Quality Gate]
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I --> J{📊 Ready to Close?}
    J -->|No| C
    J -->|Yes| K[🎉 Finalize & Report]
```

**Stack Auto-Selection**:
- **Delivery Stack** → `feature-dev-complete` (end-to-end feature shipping)
- **Operations Stack** → `production-readiness` (deployment gates, security, performance)
- **Research Stack** → `deep-research-orchestrator` (3-phase research SOP with quality gates)
- **Security Stack** → `network-security-setup` (lock down environments, layer security SOPs)
- **Specialist Stack** → Language/platform specialists (Python, TypeScript, React, etc.)

**Key Principles**:
1. **Zero Decision Paralysis**: Router auto-selects optimal skill from 171 options
2. **Context-Aware**: Detects intent from keywords, agent count, complexity signals
3. **Transparent**: Provides selection rationale and alternatives
4. **Adaptive**: Learns from corrections and adjusts future routing

## Cognitive Architecture: VeriLingua x VERIX x GlobalMOO

Context Cascade includes a sophisticated cognitive architecture for improved AI reasoning:

### VeriLingua: 7 Cognitive Frames

VeriLingua forces explicit cognitive distinctions drawn from natural languages:

| Frame | Source Language | Forces Distinction |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Evidential** | Turkish (-mis/-di) | How do you know? (witnessed/reported/inferred/assumed) |
| **Aspectual** | Russian (perfective/imperfective) | Complete or ongoing? |
| **Morphological** | Arabic (trilateral roots) | What are the semantic components? |
| **Compositional** | German (compounding) | Build from primitives |
| **Honorific** | Japanese (keigo) | Who is the audience? |
| **Classifier** | Chinese (measure words) | What type/category? |
| **Spatial** | Guugu Yimithirr (absolute direction) | Absolute position in codebase |

### VERIX: Epistemic Notation

Every claim encodes its epistemic status:

```
[illocution|affect] content [ground:source] [conf:0.XX] [state:status]
```

Example: `[assert|positive] Use async/await here [ground:performance_testing] [conf:0.92] [state:confirmed]`

### Four-Loop Self-Improvement Architecture

| Loop | Trigger | Duration | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Loop 1: Execution** | Every request | Seconds-minutes | 5-phase workflow |
| **Loop 1.5: Reflect** | Per session | Minutes | Extract learnings from corrections/approvals |
| **Loop 2: Quality** | Per session | Minutes-hours | Theater detection, audits |
| **Loop 3: Meta** | Every 3 days | Hours | Self-optimization via GlobalMOO |

### Loop 1.5: Session Reflection (NEW)

The `/reflect` skill implements per-session micro-learning:

```
Session End
    |
    v
Signal Detection (corrections, approvals, explicit rules)
    |
    v
Confidence Classification (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
    |
    v
Skill File Updates (LEARNED PATTERNS section)
    |
    v
Memory MCP Storage (for Loop 3 aggregation)
```

**Commands**:
- `/reflect` - Manual reflection on current session
- `/reflect-on` - Enable automatic reflection on session end
- `/reflect-off` - Disable automatic reflection
- `/reflect-status` - Check current state and history

**Signal Types**:
| Signal | Confidence | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Corrections ("No, use X instead") | HIGH (0.90) | Requires approval |
| Explicit Rules ("Always/Never") | HIGH (0.90) | Requires approval |
| Approvals ("Perfect", "Exactly") | MEDIUM (0.75) | Auto-apply if enabled |
| Observations (patterns) | LOW (0.55) | Auto-apply if enabled |

**Value**: Correct once, never again. Session learnings persist in skill files.

### GlobalMOO Integration

Multi-objective optimization for cognitive architecture tuning:
- **Pattern**: GlobalMOO (5D exploration) -> PyMOO NSGA-II (14D refinement)
- **Objectives**: Accuracy, Efficiency, Reliability, User Satisfaction
- **Output**: Named modes (audit, speed, research, robust, balanced)

| Mode | Accuracy | Efficiency | Use Case |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| audit | 0.960 | 0.763 | Code review, security |
| speed | 0.734 | 0.950 | Quick tasks |
| research | 0.980 | 0.824 | Deep research |
| balanced | 0.882 | 0.928 | General purpose |

## 🎯 Use Cases: Auto-Triggered Workflows

### For Individual Developers
**Start with**: `12fa-core`

**Just describe what you want - the system handles the rest:**

```bash
# ❌ Old way: Manual skill selection
"Use parallel-swarm-implementation skill to build REST API"

# ✅ New way: Natural language → automatic routing
"Build a REST API for user management"

# What happens automatically:
# 1. intent-analyzer detects feature implementation intent
# 2. orchestration-router selects parallel-swarm-implementation
# 3. 6 agents spawn in parallel (researcher, coder, reviewer, tester, documenter, theater-detector)
# 4. Result: Production-ready API in 2 hours
```

**More examples**:
```bash
# Auto-triggers quick-quality-check skill
"Quick validation before I commit"

# Auto-triggers smart-bug-fix skill
"Authentication randomly fails for OAuth users"

# Auto-triggers functionality-audit skill
"Does this code actually work?"
```

---

### For Teams
**Recommended**: `12fa-core` + `12fa-three-loop` + `12fa-security`

**Context-aware team workflows:**

```bash
# Auto-triggers research-driven-planning (Loop 1) → parallel-swarm-implementation (Loop 2)
"Add payment processing with Stripe"

# What happens:
# Loop 1: Research best practices, 5x pre-mortem, validated plan
# Loop 2: 8 agents parallel (researcher, backend, frontend, security, tester, reviewer, documenter, ops)
# Loop 3: CI/CD with auto-fix if tests fail
# Result: Payment feature deployed in 4 hours

# Auto-triggers code-review-assistant skill
"Review PR #123"

# Auto-triggers production-readiness skill
"Security review before deployment"
```

---

### For Enterprises
**Full Stack**: All 5 plugins

**Large-scale orchestration with automatic swarm coordination:**

```bash
# Auto-triggers deep-research-orchestrator for complex architecture decisions
"Migrate monolith to microservices architecture"

# What happens:
# Phase 0: Intent analysis - Architecture migration detected
# Phase 1: Prompt blueprint with constraints and success criteria
# Phase 2: Hierarchical swarm coordination (1 queen + 15 workers)
# Phase 3: Agent assignment (architecture-specialist, backend-dev, ops-engineer, etc.)
# Phase 4-6: Execution → Quality gates → Deployment
# Result: Migration plan + implementation roadmap in 1 week

# Auto-triggers hive-mind-advanced with queen-led coordination
"Complex distributed system with 20+ microservices"

# Auto-triggers network-security-setup + security stack
"Lock down production environment"
```
