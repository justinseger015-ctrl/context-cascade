## Sandbox Creation Failures

### Permissions and Access Issues

**Symptom**: Sandbox creation fails with permission denied errors, access control violations, or inability to allocate resources.

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient user permissions to create containers, virtual machines, or isolated environments
- Resource quotas preventing allocation of required compute, memory, or storage
- Network security policies blocking required connectivity for sandbox provisioning
- File system permissions preventing creation of temporary directories or volume mounts

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Verify user has necessary permissions for sandbox creation operations
2. Check resource quota limits and current usage levels
3. Examine security policies and firewall rules affecting sandbox networks
4. Test file system operations in sandbox directories with appropriate permissions

**Solutions**:
- Request elevated permissions or use service accounts with broader access
- Increase resource quotas or clean up unused resources to free capacity
- Configure network policies to allow sandbox provisioning traffic
- Use dedicated directories with explicit permission grants for sandbox operations
- Consider cloud-based sandboxes if local infrastructure has restrictive policies

### Dependency Installation Timeouts

**Symptom**: Sandbox creation hangs or times out during dependency installation phase. Package managers fail to resolve dependencies or download times exceed configured limits.

**Root Causes**:
- Network connectivity issues preventing package downloads
- Package repository mirrors offline or experiencing high load
- Dependency version conflicts requiring extensive resolution computation
- Large dependency trees exceeding reasonable installation times
- Insufficient bandwidth or rate limiting on package downloads

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Test network connectivity to package repositories from sandbox network
2. Verify package repository availability and mirror health
3. Examine dependency graphs for complexity or circular dependencies
4. Profile dependency installation to identify slow or failing packages
5. Check for network rate limiting or bandwidth constraints

**Solutions**:
- Use local package mirrors or caches to reduce external dependency
- Pre-build base images with common dependencies already installed
- Increase timeout values for environments with slow connectivity
- Use dependency lock files to skip resolution computation
- Configure multiple package repository mirrors for failover
- Implement exponential backoff and retry logic for transient failures

### Environment Configuration Drift

**Symptom**: Sandbox environments exhibit inconsistent behavior across different instantiations. Tests pass in some sandboxes but fail in others despite identical specifications.

**Root Causes**:
- Base images updating automatically without version pinning
- Environment variables set inconsistently or inherited from host
- Time synchronization issues causing timestamp-dependent failures
- Random seed initialization differences affecting non-deterministic code
- Locale or timezone settings varying between sandbox instances

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Compare environment variables between working and failing sandboxes
2. Verify base image versions and dependency lock files match exactly
3. Check system time, timezone, and locale settings for consistency
4. Examine random seed initialization and non-deterministic code paths
5. Profile startup scripts and initialization order for race conditions

**Solutions**:
- Pin base image versions explicitly and avoid latest tags
- Set all environment variables explicitly rather than inheriting from host
- Synchronize system time and use explicit timezone configuration
- Seed random number generators deterministically for reproducibility
- Document and enforce consistent locale and regional settings
- Use immutable infrastructure patterns to prevent configuration drift

## Test Execution Issues

### Environment Variable Configuration

**Symptom**: Tests fail with errors about missing configuration, undefined environment variables, or incorrect credential access.

**Root Causes**:
- Environment variables not propagated into sandbox environment
- Variable names or values incorrectly specified in configuration
- Secrets management systems inaccessible from sandbox network
- Environment variable precedence issues with multiple configuration sources
- Special characters in variable values requiring escaping or quoting

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Inspect environment variables actually present in sandbox during test execution
2. Compare expected versus actual variable names and values
3. Test secrets management system connectivity from sandbox
4. Review environment variable configuration precedence rules
5. Examine shell interpretation of special characters in values

**Solutions**:
- Use explicit environment variable injection mechanisms for sandboxes
- Validate configuration before sandbox creation with dry-run modes
- Implement local secrets management compatible with sandbox isolation
- Document variable precedence and configuration source priority
- Quote and escape special characters appropriately for shell contexts
- Use configuration validation tools to catch errors before execution

### Network Isolation Complications

**Symptom**: Tests requiring external services fail with connection timeouts, DNS resolution failures, or network unreachable errors.

**Root Causes**:
- Overly restrictive network isolation preventing legitimate external access
- DNS resolution unavailable in isolated sandbox networks
- Proxy configuration not propagating into sandbox environment
- Certificate validation failing for TLS connections
- External services rate-limiting or blocking sandbox IP ranges

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Test basic network connectivity from sandbox to external endpoints
2. Verify DNS resolution works for required domains
3. Check proxy configuration and authentication if applicable
4. Examine TLS certificate validation and trust store configuration
5. Review external service logs for blocked connection attempts

**Solutions**:
- Configure network policies to allow specific external service access
- Provide DNS resolution through sandbox networking configuration
- Propagate proxy settings and credentials into sandbox environment
- Install required certificate authorities in sandbox trust stores
- Use mock services or local equivalents instead of external dependencies
- Whitelist sandbox IP ranges with external service providers
- Implement circuit breakers for transient network failures

## Flaky Tests and Non-Determinism

### Timing-Dependent Failures

**Symptom**: Tests pass intermittently with failures appearing random. Race conditions, timing assumptions, or asynchronous operation issues cause flakiness.

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient wait times for asynchronous operations to complete
- Race conditions in concurrent code paths
- Timing assumptions about operation completion order
- Thread scheduling variations across test runs
- External service latency variations affecting test outcomes

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Increase test execution timeout and observe if failures persist
2. Add explicit synchronization and wait conditions for async operations
3. Profile execution timing to identify race condition windows
4. Run tests repeatedly to characterize failure rate and patterns
5. Examine logs for timing-related error messages or warnings

**Solutions**:
- Use explicit wait conditions that poll for expected states rather than fixed delays
- Implement proper synchronization primitives for concurrent operations
- Avoid timing assumptions and use event-driven coordination instead
- Configure async operation timeouts generously for test environments
- Mock time-dependent behavior to make tests deterministic
- Use test frameworks with built-in flakiness detection and retry mechanisms

### Non-Deterministic Code Paths

**Symptom**: Tests produce different results on identical inputs due to randomness, uninitialized variables, or undefined behavior.

**Root Causes**:
- Random number generators with unpredictable or time-based seeds
- Uninitialized variables containing arbitrary memory values
- Undefined behavior in language implementations producing varying results
- Hash table iteration order variations across language versions
- Floating-point arithmetic precision differences

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Seed random number generators with fixed values for reproducibility
2. Initialize all variables explicitly and enable compiler warnings
3. Test with sanitizers and undefined behavior detection tools
4. Lock language and runtime versions to prevent variation
5. Use exact comparison for deterministic outputs and approximate for acceptable variance

**Solutions**:
- Seed all random number generators deterministically in test mode
- Enable strict compiler settings and address all warnings
- Use memory sanitizers to detect uninitialized variable access
- Pin language versions and avoid relying on undefined behavior
- Sort collections before iteration to ensure deterministic order
- Use epsilon comparisons for floating-point arithmetic tests
- Document acceptable non-determinism and test ranges rather than exact values

## Resource Exhaustion

### Memory Leaks and Allocation Failures

**Symptom**: Tests fail with out-of-memory errors, allocation failures, or sandbox crashes due to memory exhaustion.

**Root Causes**:
- Memory leaks accumulating over test execution duration
- Insufficient memory allocation limits for test requirements
- Memory-intensive operations exceeding available resources
- Circular references preventing garbage collection
- Large test data sets consuming excessive memory

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Profile memory usage throughout test execution lifecycle
2. Identify memory leak sources with heap profiling tools
3. Analyze memory allocation patterns and peak usage
4. Review circular reference patterns preventing garbage collection
5. Estimate required memory for test data and operations

**Solutions**:
- Fix identified memory leaks through proper resource cleanup
- Increase sandbox memory limits to accommodate test requirements
- Stream large datasets instead of loading entirely into memory
- Break circular references explicitly or use weak reference patterns
- Implement periodic garbage collection in long-running tests
- Use memory-efficient data structures appropriate for scale
- Split memory-intensive tests into smaller isolated test cases

### Disk Space Exhaustion

**Symptom**: Tests fail with disk full errors, inability to write files, or sandbox storage limits exceeded.

**Root Causes**:
- Excessive logging or debug output consuming disk space
- Temporary files not being cleaned up between tests
- Test data generation producing unexpectedly large artifacts
- Insufficient disk quota for sandbox requirements
- Log rotation not configured or ineffective

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Monitor disk usage throughout test execution
2. Identify large files or directories consuming space
3. Review logging configuration and output volume
4. Check temporary file cleanup between tests
5. Estimate required disk space for complete test suite

**Solutions**:
- Reduce logging verbosity in test environments
- Implement aggressive temporary file cleanup between tests
- Configure disk quotas appropriately for test requirements
- Use streaming or incremental processing instead of batch file generation
- Enable log rotation with aggressive retention policies
- Store large test artifacts externally and reference by URL
- Monitor disk usage proactively and fail fast when limits approached

### Execution Timeouts

**Symptom**: Tests terminated prematurely due to timeout limits. Long-running operations exceed configured maximum execution time.

**Root Causes**:
- Timeout values set too conservatively for actual test requirements
- Performance degradation in code under test slowing execution
- External service latency exceeding expected bounds
- Resource contention causing slower execution than baseline
- Infinite loops or deadlocks in code under test

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Profile test execution time and identify slow operations
2. Compare execution times across different sandbox environments
3. Check for resource contention or throttling effects
4. Review timeout configuration relative to actual requirements
5. Examine code for potential infinite loops or deadlock conditions

**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout values to accommodate legitimate slow operations
- Optimize slow code paths identified through profiling
- Mock slow external dependencies with fast local equivalents
- Implement progress monitoring to detect hangs versus slow progress
- Use timeout hierarchies with different limits for different operation types
- Profile and address performance regressions causing slowdowns
- Implement watchdog mechanisms to detect and break deadlocks

## Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

### Pipeline Environment Differences

**Symptom**: Tests pass locally but fail in CI/CD pipeline execution. Environment differences between local and pipeline sandboxes cause inconsistent results.

**Root Causes**:
- Different base images or dependency versions between environments
- Environment variables configured differently in CI/CD
- Network access restrictions in pipeline environments
- File paths or directory structures varying between local and CI
- Resource limits more restrictive in CI/CD infrastructure

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Compare environment configurations between local and CI/CD
2. Verify dependency versions match exactly across environments
3. Test network connectivity and access policies in pipeline
4. Examine file system layouts and working directories
5. Review resource allocation and limits in CI/CD configuration

**Solutions**:
- Use identical base images and dependency lock files everywhere
- Document environment requirements and validate in CI/CD setup
- Configure CI/CD environment variables to match local development
- Use relative paths and avoid assumptions about absolute locations
- Request appropriate resource allocations for CI/CD pipelines
- Test pipeline configuration changes in development environment first

### Pipeline Flakiness Management

**Symptom**: CI/CD pipeline exhibits intermittent failures not reproducible locally. Flaky tests undermine confidence in continuous integration results.

**Root Causes**:
- Resource contention from concurrent pipeline executions
- Timing-dependent failures more pronounced in CI/CD environment
- Network reliability issues in cloud CI/CD infrastructure
- Insufficient isolation between parallel test executions
- Race conditions in pipeline orchestration logic

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Track failure patterns and identify consistently flaky tests
2. Analyze correlation between failures and pipeline concurrency
3. Review test isolation and cleanup between executions
4. Profile resource usage during concurrent pipeline runs
5. Examine CI/CD logs for infrastructure-level issues

**Solutions**:
- Quarantine flaky tests and fix before reintegrating into pipeline
- Implement automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Use test result caching to avoid re-running stable tests
- Increase resource allocation to reduce contention effects
- Serialize inherently non-parallelizable test executions
- Configure pipeline execution concurrency limits
- Implement robust cleanup and isolation between pipeline stages

## Debugging the Debugger

### Audit Tool Failures

**Symptom**: The functionality audit tool itself crashes, hangs, or produces incorrect results. Meta-debugging required to restore audit capability.

**Root Causes**:
- Bugs in audit tool implementation affecting its own correctness
- Resource exhaustion in audit orchestration logic
- Incompatibility between audit tool and target code environment
- Configuration errors in audit tool setup
- Dependencies of audit tool failing or unavailable

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Isolate whether issue is in audit tool or code under test
2. Test audit tool against known-good reference code
3. Review audit tool logs and error messages for diagnostic information
4. Verify audit tool dependencies and configuration correctness
5. Attempt minimal reproduction of audit tool failure

**Solutions**:
- Update audit tool to latest stable version with bug fixes
- Report bugs to audit tool maintainers with reproduction cases
- Work around known audit tool issues when fixes unavailable
- Use alternative audit approaches when tool limitations encountered
- Increase audit tool resource allocations if exhaustion detected
- Validate audit tool configuration before use on target code

### False Positive and False Negative Results

**Symptom**: Audit tool reports failures for correct code (false positives) or passes incorrect code (false negatives). Result reliability compromised.

**Root Causes**:
- Incorrect test assertions or expected behavior specifications
- Overly strict validation criteria catching acceptable variations
- Insufficient test coverage missing actual bugs
- Mock services behaving differently than real implementations
- Test data not representative of production conditions

**Diagnostic Approach**:
1. Review reported failures to determine if they represent real bugs
2. Examine test assertions for correctness and appropriateness
3. Measure test coverage and identify gaps in validation
4. Compare mock service behavior against real service contracts
5. Validate test data representativeness of production inputs

**Solutions**:
- Correct incorrect assertions and expected behavior specifications
- Relax overly strict validation where appropriate variation exists
- Expand test coverage to exercise additional code paths
- Improve mock service fidelity to real service behavior
- Use production data or production-like samples for testing
- Implement differential testing against reference implementations
- Add meta-tests that validate audit tool itself produces correct results
