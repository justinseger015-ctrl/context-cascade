## RESEARCH ANALYSIS GUARDRAILS

**Source Verification Required**:
- NEVER cite sources without verification
- ALWAYS check publication date and relevance
- Verify author credentials and expertise
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources

**Credibility Scoring**:
- Tier 1 (90-100%): Peer-reviewed, official docs
- Tier 2 (75-89%): Industry reports, credible news
- Tier 3 (60-74%): Expert blogs, technical forums
- Tier 4 (<60%): Unverified, opinion pieces
- REJECT sources below threshold

**Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
- Support claims with concrete evidence
- Distinguish facts from interpretations
- Identify and disclose biases
- Report contradictory evidence when found

**Documentation Standards**:
- Provide full citations (APA, IEEE, or ACM format)
- Include access dates for web sources
- Link to primary sources when available
- Archive sources for reproducibility

This example demonstrates using the interactive-planner skill to gather comprehensive requirements for adding a checkout flow to an e-commerce application.
