## RESEARCH ANALYSIS GUARDRAILS

**Source Verification Required**:
- NEVER cite sources without verification
- ALWAYS check publication date and relevance
- Verify author credentials and expertise
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources

**Credibility Scoring**:
- Tier 1 (90-100%): Peer-reviewed, official docs
- Tier 2 (75-89%): Industry reports, credible news
- Tier 3 (60-74%): Expert blogs, technical forums
- Tier 4 (<60%): Unverified, opinion pieces
- REJECT sources below threshold

**Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
- Support claims with concrete evidence
- Distinguish facts from interpretations
- Identify and disclose biases
- Report contradictory evidence when found

**Documentation Standards**:
- Provide full citations (APA, IEEE, or ACM format)
- Include access dates for web sources
- Link to primary sources when available
- Archive sources for reproducibility

This example demonstrates advanced use of multi-select questions to gather detailed feature requirements for a headless CMS.

## Scenario

**User Request**: "We're building a headless CMS for our marketing team. It needs to support multiple content types, rich media, collaboration, and integration with our existing tech stack."

**Complexity**: Complex (15+ files)

**Use Case**: Multi-select questions allow users to specify exactly which features they need without forcing artificial either/or choices.

## Multi-Select Question Strategy

### Batch 1: Content Capabilities (4 Questions, 3 Multi-Select)

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "What content types do you need to support? (Select all)"
    header: "Content"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Users likely need multiple content types
    options:
      - label: "Blog posts"
        description: "Articles, news, blog content with rich text"
      - label: "Pages"
        description: "Static pages (About, Contact, etc.)"
      - label: "Products"
        description: "E-commerce product catalog"
      - label: "Media assets"
        description: "Images, videos, documents library"

    user_answer: ["Blog posts", "Pages", "Media assets"]
    # User didn't select "Products" - not an e-commerce use case

  - question: "What rich media features are required? (Select all)"
    header: "Media"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Media features are not mutually exclusive
    options:
      - label: "Image optimization"
        description: "Automatic resizing, WebP conversion, CDN"
      - label: "Video hosting"
        description: "Video upload, transcoding, streaming"
      - label: "Document management"
        description: "PDF, DOCX storage and version control"
      - label: "Digital assets (DAM)"
        description: "Full DAM with metadata, tagging, search"

    user_answer: ["Image optimization", "Document management", "Digital assets (DAM)"]
    # Video hosting not selected - reduces scope

  - question: "What collaboration features do you need? (Select all)"
    header: "Collab"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Teams often need multiple collaboration features
    options:
      - label: "Real-time editing"
        description: "Google Docs-style collaborative editing"
      - label: "Comments/reviews"
        description: "Inline comments and review workflows"
      - label: "Version history"
        description: "Track changes and revert to previous versions"
      - label: "Approval workflows"
        description: "Multi-step content approval process"

    user_answer: ["Comments/reviews", "Version history", "Approval workflows"]
    # Real-time editing not selected - reduces complexity

  - question: "What publishing model best fits your workflow?"
    header: "Publishing"
    multiSelect: false  # Single-select: Publishing models are mutually exclusive
    options:
      - label: "Instant publish"
        description: "Content goes live immediately on save"
      - label: "Manual publish"
        description: "Authors explicitly publish when ready"
      - label: "Scheduled publish"
        description: "Set future publish dates and times"
      - label: "Draft/publish/archive"
        description: "Full content lifecycle management"

    user_answer: "Draft/publish/archive"
    # Single answer - clear publishing workflow needed
```

**Analysis After Batch 1**:
- Content types: Blog posts, pages, media assets (NOT products)
- Media: Image optimization, document management, DAM (NOT video)
- Collaboration: Comments, version history, approvals (NOT real-time editing)
- Publishing: Full lifecycle (draft → publish → archive)

**Multi-Select Benefit**: Instead of asking "Do you need approval workflows?" 4 times, one question gathered all collaboration requirements. Saves 3 questions.

### Batch 2: Integration & APIs (4 Questions, All Multi-Select)

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "What frontend frameworks will consume the CMS? (Select all)"
    header: "Frontend"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Headless CMS often serves multiple frontends
    options:
      - label: "Next.js"
        description: "React with SSR/SSG via Next.js"
      - label: "Gatsby"
        description: "Static site generator with GraphQL"
      - label: "Mobile apps"

    user_answer: ["Analytics", "SEO tools", "CDN/hosting"]
    # Translation not needed (English-only for now)

  - question: "What authentication methods for API access? (Select all)"
    header: "API Auth"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Different clients may use different auth
    options:
      - label: "API keys"
        description: "Simple API key authentication"
      - label: "OAuth 2.0"
        description: "OAuth for third-party app access"
      - label: "JWT tokens"
        description: "Stateless JWT tokens for SPAs"
      - label: "Webhooks"
        description: "Signed webhooks for event delivery"

    user_answer: ["API keys", "JWT tokens", "Webhooks"]
    # Multiple auth methods for different use cases
```

**Analysis After Batch 2**:
- Frontends: Next.js, mobile apps (multi-platform)
- APIs: REST, GraphQL, webhooks (flexible API design)
- Integrations: Analytics, SEO, CDN (NOT translation yet)
- API Auth: API keys, JWT, signed webhooks (3 methods)

**Multi-Select Benefit**: Asking "What integrations?" as multi-select captured all integration needs in one question vs 4 yes/no questions.

### Batch 3: Content Modeling & Features (4 Questions, 3 Multi-Select)

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "What content modeling features are needed? (Select all)"
    header: "Modeling"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Advanced CMS features are additive
    options:
      - label: "Custom fields"
        description: "Text, number, date, rich text, relationship fields"
      - label: "Content relationships"
        description: "References between content types"

        description: "Categories, tags, custom taxonomies"
      - label: "Repeatable fields"
        description: "Dynamic field groups (e.g., FAQ items)"

    user_answer: ["Custom fields", "Content relationships", "Taxonomies", "Repeatable fields"]
    # All modeling features needed - complex data model

  - question: "What search and filtering capabilities? (Select all)"
    header: "Search"
    multiSelect: true  # Multi-select: Search features build on each other
    options:
      - label: "Full-text search"
        description: "Search across all content fields"
      - label: "Faceted search"
        description: "Filter by category, tags, date, etc."
      - label: "Fuzzy search"
        description: "Typo-tolerant search with Algolia/Elasticsearch"
      - label: "Related content"
        description: "AI-powered content recommendations"

    user_answer: ["Full-text search", "Faceted search", "Fuzzy search"]
    # Advanced search needed, but not AI recommendations (yet)

  - question: "What localization/i18n features are needed? (Select all)"
    header: "i18n"

        description: "Different images per language/region"
      - label: "Translation workflows"
        description: "Send content to translators, track progress"

    user_answer: []  # EMPTY - No i18n needed for now
    # Important: Multi-select with NO selections = feature not needed

  - question: "What is the expected content volume?"
    header: "Scale"
    multiSelect: false  # Single-select: Exclusive scale tiers
    options:
      - label: "Small (<1000 items)"
        description: "Simple site with limited content"
      - label: "Medium (1K-10K)"
        description: "Growing site with regular updates"
      - label: "Large (10K-100K)"
        description: "Major publication with extensive content"
      - label: "Massive (100K+)"
        description: "Enterprise-scale content library"

    user_answer: "Medium (1K-10K)"
    # Medium scale - affects database/caching decisions
```

**Analysis After Batch 3**:
- Modeling: All features needed (custom fields, relationships, taxonomies, repeatable)
- Search: Full-text, faceted, fuzzy (advanced search required)
- i18n: NONE selected (English-only, simplifies scope significantly)
- Scale: Medium (1K-10K items)

**Multi-Select Benefit**: i18n question with ZERO selections clearly communicated "we don't need this" vs having to say "no" to 4 separate questions.

### Batch 4: Security & Deployment (4 Questions, 3 Multi-Select)

```yaml
questions:
  - question: "What user roles are needed for the CMS? (Select all)"

      - label: "Export functionality"
        description: "Export all content to JSON/XML"

    user_answer: ["Automated backups", "Point-in-time recovery", "Export functionality"]
    # Strong backup strategy, but not geo-redundancy (cost)

  - question: "What hosting/deployment model?"
    header: "Hosting"
    multiSelect: false  # Single-select: Hosting models are mutually exclusive
    options:
      - label: "Cloud SaaS"
        description: "Fully managed (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi Cloud)"
      - label: "Self-hosted"
        description: "Deploy on own infrastructure (AWS, GCP)"
      - label: "Hybrid"
        description: "Self-hosted with managed database"
      - label: "On-premises"
        description: "Internal servers (strict compliance)"

    user_answer: "Self-hosted"
    # Self-hosted for control and cost (AWS infrastructure)
```

**Analysis After Batch 4**:
- Roles: All 4 roles needed (editor, publisher, admin, reviewer)
- Security: All features (RBAC, content permissions, audit logs, 2FA)
- Backup: Automated, point-in-time, export (NOT geo-redundancy)
- Hosting: Self-hosted (AWS/GCP)

**Multi-Select Benefit**: Security question gathered 4 requirements in one question. If these were yes/no questions, would need 4 separate questions.

## Multi-Select Statistics

**Total Questions**: 16 (4 batches × 4 questions)
**Multi-Select Questions**: 13 (81%)
**Single-Select Questions**: 3 (19%)

**Efficiency Gain**:
- If all multi-select questions were broken into individual yes/no questions:
  - 13 multi-select questions × avg 3.5 options = ~45 yes/no questions
  - Combined with 3 single-select = 48 total questions
  - **Actual questions asked: 16**
  - **Efficiency: 67% fewer questions** (16 vs 48)
