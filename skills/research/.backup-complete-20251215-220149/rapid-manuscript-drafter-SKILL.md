# Rapid Manuscript Drafter

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.



## Purpose

Generate structured, scaffolded research manuscript drafts in 10-15 minutes that provide a solid foundation for academic writing. Unlike tools that fabricate content, this skill creates honest drafts with clear placeholders for user-provided data and findings.

## Critical Ethical Stance

**This skill NEVER fabricates research results or data.**

What we DO:
- Generate document structure and section scaffolding
- Write introduction and background based on known literature
- Create methodology templates based on described approach
- Provide results section structure with [YOUR_DATA] placeholders
- Draft discussion frameworks with logical argument structure

What we DON'T DO:
- Invent experimental results
- Fabricate statistical findings
- Create fake tables or figures with made-up numbers
- Generate citations to non-existent papers

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Have a research idea ready to write up
- Need to quickly produce a first draft
- Want to overcome blank page syndrome
- Preparing a manuscript outline for collaborators
- Writing conference paper with tight deadline
- Need structured template for thesis chapter

**DO NOT** use this skill for:
- Final polished manuscripts (this is a first draft tool)
- Generating fake research (we don't do that)
- Replacing actual research work

## Manuscript Types Supported

1. **Research Article** (IMRaD format)
2. **Conference Paper** (shorter, focused)
3. **Review Article** (literature synthesis)
4. **Technical Report**
5. **Thesis Chapter**

## SOP Phase 3: Writing Tips Insertion

Add contextual writing guidance:

```markdown
<!-- WRITING TIP: Introduction Hook -->
Start with a compelling fact, statistic, or scenario that immediately
demonstrates why this research matters. Avoid generic openings like
"In recent years..." when possible.

<!-- WRITING TIP: Results Section -->
Lead with your most important finding. Use topic sentences that state
the finding, then provide evidence. Don't interpret here - save that
for Discussion.

<!-- WRITING TIP: Placeholder Completion -->
Replace [YOUR_DATA] placeholders with actual values. Ensure all claims
are supported by your actual results.
```
