## Test Overview
Validates Intent Analyzer's ability to extract contextual signals (temporal, audience, expertise, constraints) from user requests and use this context to inform interpretation. Tests implicit constraint detection, expertise calibration, and appropriate response adaptation.

## Validation Checklist

For each context analysis scenario:

### Signal Detection
- [ ] Temporal signals (urgency, timeline, quality) extracted
- [ ] Audience indicators (expertise, formality) identified
- [ ] Constraint markers (tech, resources, quality) detected
- [ ] Meta-request patterns recognized
- [ ] Expertise level calibrated from terminology

### Context Integration
- [ ] Multiple context signals synthesized coherently
- [ ] Contradictory signals flagged appropriately
- [ ] Context informs response strategy
- [ ] Implicit constraints surfaced

### Response Adaptation
- [ ] Response complexity matches expertise level
- [ ] Urgency reflected in solution approach
- [ ] All constraints respected in suggestions
- [ ] Audience type determines communication style
- [ ] Meta-requests handled appropriately

### Script Validation
- [ ] pattern-extractor.js detects all signal types
- [ ] Context summary accurately reflects signals
- [ ] Interpretation guidance aligns with detected patterns
- [ ] Conflicting patterns flagged in summary

## Success Metrics
- [assert|neutral] *Signal Detection Rate**: >95% for explicit signals [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Implicit Constraint Detection**: >70% for commonly-implied constraints [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Expertise Calibration Accuracy**: >85% correct level assignment [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Context-Response Alignment**: 100% of constraints respected in suggestions [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Meta-Request Handling**: 100% appropriate response strategy [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Conflicting Context
**Request**: "I need enterprise-grade security but can't use any paid services"
**Conflict**: Enterprise requirements vs free constraint
**Strategy**: Acknowledge tension, suggest best free options, note limitations

### Edge Case 2: Implied vs Explicit
**Request**: "Quick script for parsing logs"
**Explicit**: Quick (temporal)
**Implicit**: Production use? Learning? One-time task?
**Strategy**: Proceed with quick solution, note assumptions

### Edge Case 3: Context Evolution
**Request**: Initial: "Explain authentication", Follow-up: "I need to implement this for 1M users"
**Context Shift**: Learning → Production at scale
**Strategy**: Adapt from educational to production-focused

## Notes

Context analysis is critical for appropriate response calibration. The goal is extracting maximum relevant context from minimal explicit signals, while avoiding over-inference. When context is ambiguous or contradictory, clarification questions should target the specific contextual dimension (urgency? audience? constraints?) rather than the task itself.
