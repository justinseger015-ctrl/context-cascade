## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Research + Implementation
**User Request**: "Research best practices for microservices authentication and implement JWT-based auth for our Node.js API"

**Expected Analysis**:
```json
{
  "primary_category": "technical",
  "confidence": 0.60,
  "categories": {
    "technical": 0.60,
    "analytical": 0.35,
    "learning": 0.05
  },
  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: technical, analytical. Moderate confidence (0.60) in technical intent - proceed with assumption acknowledgment. Request contains both research (analytical) and implementation (technical) components. Key signals: research (verb), best practices (phrase), implement (verb)"
}
```

**Expected Pattern Extraction**:
```json
{
  "constraints": [
    {
      "pattern": "technology_stack",
      "signal": "technology_constraint",
      "matches": [
        {"matched_text": "JWT", "position": 70},
        {"matched_text": "Node.js", "position": 93}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "expertise": [
    {
      "pattern": "expert_terminology",
      "signal": "expert_user",
      "matches": [
        {"matched_text": "microservices", "position": 23},
        {"matched_text": "JWT", "position": 70}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Response Structure**:
1. **Phase 1 - Research**: Best practices analysis for microservices auth
2. **Phase 2 - Implementation**: JWT implementation for Node.js
3. Both phases addressed in coherent workflow

**Pass Criteria**:
- ✅ Recognizes dual intent (research + implementation)
- ✅ Technical as primary, analytical as significant secondary
- ✅ Response structure addresses both intents
- ✅ No clarification needed (both intents are clear)

### Scenario 2: Learning + Decision Making
**User Request**: "Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases and help me decide which to use for a social media app"

**Expected Analysis**:
```json
{
  "primary_category": "learning",
  "confidence": 0.50,
  "categories": {
    "learning": 0.50,
    "decision": 0.45,
    "analytical": 0.05
  },
  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: learning, decision. Equal confidence (0.50 vs 0.45) - both intents equally important. Key signals: explain (verb), difference (noun), help me decide (phrase), which to use (phrase)"
}
```

**Expected Pattern Extraction**:
```json
{
  "constraints": [
    {
      "pattern": "explicit_tech",
      "signal": "technology_constraint",
      "matches": [
        {"matched_text": "SQL", "position": 26},
        {"matched_text": "NoSQL", "position": 34}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": [],
  "expertise": []
}
```

**Expected Response Structure**:
1. **Educational Component**: SQL vs NoSQL comparison
2. **Decision Framework**: How to choose between them
3. **Specific Recommendation**: For social media app use case

**Pass Criteria**:
- ✅ Detects near-equal probability for learning + decision
- ✅ Response balances education with actionable recommendation
- ✅ Tailors decision advice to specific use case (social media)
- ✅ Proceeds without clarification (both intents clear)

### Scenario 3: Creation + Validation
**User Request**: "Write a Python function to validate email addresses and tell me if my implementation approach is correct"

**Expected Analysis**:
```json
{
  "primary_category": "technical",
  "confidence": 0.65,
  "categories": {
    "technical": 0.65,
    "analytical": 0.30,
    "learning": 0.05
  },
  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: technical, analytical. Moderate confidence (0.65) in technical intent - proceed with assumption acknowledgment. Request contains creation (technical) and validation (analytical) components. Key signals: write (verb), function (noun), validate (verb), tell me if (phrase)"
}
```

**Expected Clarification Questions**:
Despite no overall clarification required, should ask:
1. "Do you have an existing implementation you'd like me to review, or should I write one and explain the approach?"

This disambiguates whether user has code to review or wants new code + explanation.

**Expected Response Structure**:
**If user has implementation**:
1. Review their approach
2. Provide corrected/improved version
3. Explain validation best practices

**If user wants new implementation**:
1. Write function with best practices
2. Explain approach and design decisions
3. Discuss alternative approaches

**Pass Criteria**:
- ✅ Detects creation + validation dual intent
- ✅ Asks clarifying question to determine which comes first
- ✅ Adapts response based on clarification
- ✅ Moderate confidence appropriately triggers assumption acknowledgment

    "technical": 0.05
  },
  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: problem_solving, learning. Moderate confidence (0.55) in problem_solving intent - proceed with assumption acknowledgment. User has active problem but also wants to understand. Key signals: getting error (phrase), explain (verb), fix (verb)"
}
```

**Expected Pattern Extraction**:
```json
{
  "temporal": [
    {
      "pattern": "high_urgency",
      "signal": "high_urgency",
      "interpretation": "Implied urgency from active error/problem"
    }
  ],

    {
      "pattern": "technology_stack",
      "signal": "technology_constraint",
      "matches": [{"matched_text": "React", "position": 31}]
    }
  ],
  "meta": [],

  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: analytical, decision, technical. Low-moderate confidence (0.45) across three distinct phases. Key signals: evaluate (verb), recommend (verb), show me (phrase). Three-phase request: analysis → decision → implementation"
}
```

**Expected Pattern Extraction**:
```json
{
  "constraints": [
    {
      "pattern": "technology_stack",
      "signal": "technology_constraint",

    "decision": 0.05
  },
  "multi_intent": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "requires_clarification": false,
  "reasoning": "Multiple intent categories detected: creative, analytical. Moderate confidence (0.55) in creative intent - proceed with assumption acknowledgment. Request requires both generation (creative) and evaluation (analytical). Key signals: generate (verb), ideas (noun), rank (verb)"
}
```

## Multi-Intent Complexity Matrix

| Complexity | Intent Count | Confidence Range | Clarification? | Example |
|------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Simple** | 2 intents | 60-40 split | No | "Explain X and show example" |
| **Moderate** | 2-3 intents | 50-30-20 split | Sometimes | "Research, recommend, implement" |
| **Complex** | 3+ intents | Even distribution | Often | "Compare, analyze, decide, build, document" |
| **Sequential** | 2-3 intents | Clear ordering | No | "Fix bug then explain what caused it" |
| **Parallel** | 2-3 intents | No clear order | Sometimes | "Improve performance and add features" |

## Validation Checklist

For each multi-intent scenario:

### Intent Recognition
- [ ] All significant intents (>25% probability) identified
- [ ] Primary intent correctly determined
- [ ] Multi-intent flag set appropriately
- [ ] Intent relationships understood (sequential, parallel, nested)

### Response Strategy
- [ ] Response structure addresses all intents
- [ ] Intent ordering makes logical sense
- [ ] Primary intent receives appropriate focus
- [ ] Secondary intents not ignored

### Clarification Judgment
- [ ] Clear multi-intent doesn't trigger unnecessary clarification
- [ ] Ambiguous multi-intent triggers appropriate questions
- [ ] Questions disambiguate intent priorities when needed
- [ ] Proceeds confidently when all intents are clear

### Script Validation
- [ ] intent-classifier.py detects multi-intent correctly
- [ ] pattern-extractor.js identifies signals for each intent
- [ ] clarification-generator.py creates appropriate questions for ambiguous cases
- [ ] intent-validator.sh validates multi-intent analyses

## Success Metrics
- [assert|neutral] *Multi-Intent Detection**: 100% for requests with 2+ genuine intents [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *False Positive Rate**: <5% for single-intent requests incorrectly flagged as multi-intent [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Response Completeness**: 100% of identified intents addressed in response [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Structural Coherence**: Intents organized logically (sequential, priority-based, etc.) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Clarification Precision**: Only ask about intent priorities when genuinely ambiguous [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Implied Multi-Intent
**Request**: "Debug this code"
**Hidden Intents**: Fix bug (primary) + Explain what was wrong (implied learning)
**Strategy**: Address both even though learning not explicit

### Edge Case 2: Conflicting Intents
**Request**: "Keep it simple but make it production-ready"
**Conflict**: Simple vs Production-ready often in tension
**Strategy**: Clarify priority or find middle ground (simple architecture, production practices)

### Edge Case 3: Nested Intents
**Request**: "Teach me how to build an API by walking through creating one"
**Structure**: Learning (outer) contains Technical (inner)
**Strategy**: Recognize teaching as delivery mechanism for implementation

## Notes

Multi-intent requests are common in real-world usage. The key is distinguishing between:
1. **Genuine multi-intent**: Multiple distinct goals that all matter
2. **Nested intent**: One intent is the mechanism for achieving another
3. **Sequential intent**: Multiple phases of a single larger goal

Successful handling requires understanding these relationships and structuring responses accordingly.
