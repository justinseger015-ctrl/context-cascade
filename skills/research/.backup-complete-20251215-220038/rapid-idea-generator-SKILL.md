# Rapid Idea Generator

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.



## Purpose

Generate 5-10 actionable research ideas from any topic in under 5 minutes using structured causal analysis, while maintaining full transparency about reasoning (unlike black-box tools).

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:
- Starting a new research project and need direction
- Exploring an unfamiliar research domain
- Need multiple research directions from a single topic
- Want to quickly identify research gaps before deep literature review
- Brainstorming for grant proposals or thesis topics
- Need to pivot research direction rapidly

**DO NOT** use this skill for:
- Deep literature review (use literature-synthesis instead)
- Validating existing ideas (use baseline-replication instead)
- Writing manuscripts (use rapid-manuscript-drafter instead)

## Time Investment

- **Quick Mode**: 2-3 minutes (3-5 ideas)
- **Standard Mode**: 5 minutes (5-8 ideas)
- **Comprehensive Mode**: 10-15 minutes (10-15 ideas with expanded details)

## Specialist Agent

I am a Research Ideation Specialist combining 5-Whys methodology with MECE decomposition.

**Methodology (Plan-and-Solve + Self-Consistency)**:
1. Parse topic and identify core domain
2. Conduct Primary Analysis (situational assessment)
3. Perform Component Analysis (MECE decomposition)
4. Apply Causal Analysis (5-Whys for each component)
5. Identify Root Causes and research opportunities
6. Generate ranked ideas with confidence scores
7. Cross-validate ideas for novelty and feasibility

**Failure Modes & Mitigations**:
- Topic too broad: Request narrowing or suggest sub-domains
- Topic too niche: Expand scope with related areas
- Low-quality ideas: Apply novelty and feasibility filters
- Missing domain knowledge: Flag for researcher validation

## Input Contract

```yaml

  topic: string (required)
    # Research topic or area of interest

## SOP Phase 1: Primary Analysis

**Objective**: Understand the research landscape in 60 seconds.

```markdown
## Primary Analysis for [TOPIC]

### Domain Assessment
- **Field**: [Identify primary research field]
- **Sub-fields**: [List 2-3 relevant sub-fields]
- **Maturity**: [emerging | growing | mature | declining]

### Current State of Research
[2-3 sentences on where the field stands today]

### Main Challenges
1. [Challenge 1 - most pressing]
2. [Challenge 2]
3. [Challenge 3]

### Key Research Questions Being Asked
1. [Active question 1]
2. [Active question 2]
```

## SOP Phase 2: Component Analysis (MECE)

**Objective**: Decompose the topic into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive components.

```markdown
## Component Analysis

| Component | Importance | Research Potential | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| [Component 1] | High | [Potential] | [Notes] |
| [Component 2] | Medium | [Potential] | [Notes] |
| [Component 3] | Low | [Potential] | [Notes] |

### MECE Validation
- [ ] Components are mutually exclusive (no overlap)
- [ ] Components are collectively exhaustive (cover entire topic)
- [ ] Each component has research potential identified
```

## SOP Phase 3: Causal Analysis (5-Whys)

**Objective**: Trace each major challenge to its root cause.

For each high-importance component, apply 5-Whys:

```markdown
## Causal Chain: [Problem Statement]

1. **Why 1?** [First-level cause]
2. **Why 2?** [Second-level cause]
3. **Why 3?** [Third-level cause]
4. **Why 4?** [Fourth-level cause]
5. **Why 5?** [Root cause]

**Root Cause Identified**: [Actionable root cause]
**Research Opportunity**: [How addressing this creates research value]
```

## SOP Phase 4: Idea Generation
