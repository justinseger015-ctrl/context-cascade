## RESEARCH ANALYSIS GUARDRAILS

**Source Verification Required**:
- NEVER cite sources without verification
- ALWAYS check publication date and relevance
- Verify author credentials and expertise
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources

**Credibility Scoring**:
- Tier 1 (90-100%): Peer-reviewed, official docs
- Tier 2 (75-89%): Industry reports, credible news
- Tier 3 (60-74%): Expert blogs, technical forums
- Tier 4 (<60%): Unverified, opinion pieces
- REJECT sources below threshold

**Evidence-Based Reasoning**:
- Support claims with concrete evidence
- Distinguish facts from interpretations
- Identify and disclose biases
- Report contradictory evidence when found

**Documentation Standards**:
- Provide full citations (APA, IEEE, or ACM format)
- Include access dates for web sources
- Link to primary sources when available
- Archive sources for reproducibility

## Test Objective
Validate Level 3 (Deep Dive) workflow with comprehensive synthesis, claim clustering, and conflict resolution.

## Test Scenario
**Query**: "What are the trade-offs between different model compression techniques for LLMs?"
**Expected Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Credibility Threshold**: > 90%
**Target Sources**: 10+ sources
**Synthesis Mode**: Consensus with conflict analysis

## Test Steps

### 1. Execute Full Research Pipeline

#### Step 1.1: Multi-Source Aggregation
```bash
# Aggregate 10+ sources with high credibility
python resources/scripts/research-orchestrator.py \
  --query "LLM model compression quantization pruning distillation" \
  --sources 15 \
  --min-credibility 90 \
  --output synthesis-test-sources.md \
  --json
```

**Expected**: 10-15 sources, avg credibility >= 90%

#### Step 1.2: SOTA Analysis
```bash
# Analyze state-of-the-art methods
node resources/scripts/sota-analyzer.js \
  --domain "natural-language-processing" \
  --task "model-compression" \
  --years 2022-2024 \
  --output synthesis-test-sota.json
```

**Expected**: Reproducibility scores, trend analysis, performance metrics

#### Step 1.3: Knowledge Synthesis
```bash
# Synthesize claims from all sources
python resources/scripts/knowledge-synthesizer.py \
  --sources synthesis-test-sources.json \
  --mode consensus \
  --similarity 0.6 \
  --output synthesis-test-report.md
```

**Expected**: Claim clusters, consensus statements, contradiction detection

### 2. Verify Synthesis Quality

**Required Elements**:
- [x] Claim extraction (50+ claims)
- [x] Claim clustering (10+ clusters)
- [x] Agreement scoring (0-100%)
- [x] Consensus statements for high-agreement clusters
- [x] Contradiction detection and analysis
- [x] Evidence-based synthesis

**Sample Expected Output**:
```markdown
## Consensus Findings (High Agreement)

### 1. Quantization is Most Practical for Deployment
**Agreement Score**: 92.5%
**Sources**: 12

**Consensus**: Quantization (INT8/INT4) achieves 2-4x speedup with <2% accuracy
loss and is easiest to implement in production environments.

Supporting Evidence:
- Source 1 (95%): "INT8 quantization reduces model size by 75% with minimal loss"
- Source 3 (92%): "Quantization outperforms pruning for deployment efficiency"
- Source 5 (88%): "4-bit quantization maintains 98% accuracy on most tasks"

## Detected Contradictions

### Contradiction 1: Pruning Effectiveness
**Topic**: Impact of unstructured pruning on performance

**Conflicting Claims**:
```
Source 2 (Credibility: 90%): "Unstructured pruning can remove 80% of weights
without accuracy loss"

Source 7 (Credibility: 93%): "Unstructured pruning beyond 50% significantly
degrades performance in our experiments"
```

**Resolution**: Dataset-dependent. Source 2 used BERT, Source 7 used GPT-style models.
```

### 3. Verify Trend Analysis

**Required Metrics**:
- [x] Year-over-year publication trends
- [x] Method popularity changes
- [x] Performance improvements over time
- [x] Code availability trends
- [x] Reproducibility trends

**Sample Expected Trends**:
```json
{
  "trends": {
    "2022": {
      "quantization": 45,
      "pruning": 30,
      "distillation": 25
    },
    "2023": {
      "quantization": 60,
      "pruning": 25,
      "distillation": 35
    },
    "2024": {
      "quantization": 75,
      "pruning": 20,
      "distillation": 42
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Edge Cases

**Test 4.1**: High Disagreement Cluster
- Expected: Flag as "further investigation needed"
- Expected: List all conflicting claims with sources

**Test 4.2**: Insufficient Claim Similarity
- Scenario: Claims too diverse to cluster (similarity < 0.3)
- Expected: Create individual clusters or expand similarity threshold

**Test 4.3**: Bias Detection
- Expected: Identify if all sources come from same group/institution
- Expected: Warning about potential echo chamber
