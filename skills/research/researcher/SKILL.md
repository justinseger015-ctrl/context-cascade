# Researcher - Systematic Information Gathering

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.



Systematic multi-level research with integrated Gemini Search for comprehensive knowledge synthesis.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when conducting technical research, gathering information on unfamiliar topics, comparing technologies or approaches, validating claims with credible sources, or building comprehensive knowledge bases.

## 3-Level Research Methodology

### Level 1: Basic Research (< 5 minutes)
- Quick factual queries
- Single-source validation
- Surface-level understanding
- Immediate answers needed

**Process**:
1. Query Gemini Search for primary information
2. Validate source credibility (>70%)
3. Extract key facts
4. Provide concise summary

### Level 2: Multi-Source Research (15-30 minutes)
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Deeper analysis required
- Technical understanding needed
- Comprehensive overview desired

**Process**:
1. Query 3-5 authoritative sources
2. Compare and contrast findings
3. Identify consensus and disagreements
4. Synthesize into coherent analysis
5. Score sources for credibility (>85%)

### Level 3: Deep Dive Research (1+ hours)
- Extensive investigation
- Academic rigor required
- Complex topic with nuances
- Publication-ready research

**Process**:
1. Systematic literature review
2. Query 10+ diverse sources
3. Analyze methodology and evidence
4. Identify research gaps
5. Synthesize comprehensive report
6. Ensure 90%+ source credibility

## Source Evaluation Criteria

### Credibility Scoring (0-100%)
- **Authority** (30%): Expert author, institutional backing
- **Accuracy** (25%): Fact-checked, peer-reviewed, verifiable
- **Objectivity** (20%): Minimal bias, balanced perspective
- **Currency** (15%): Recent publication, up-to-date information
- **Coverage** (10%): Comprehensive treatment of topic

### Source Types by Reliability
1. **Tier 1 (90-100%)**: Peer-reviewed journals, official documentation
2. **Tier 2 (75-89%)**: Industry reports, credible news outlets
3. **Tier 3 (60-74%)**: Blog posts from experts, technical forums
4. **Tier 4 (<60%)**: Unverified sources, opinion pieces

## Gemini Search Integration

- Use `gemini-search` skill for web queries
- Enable grounded search for factual accuracy
- Leverage Google Search API for broad coverage
- Apply source verification automatically

## Output Formats

- **Summary**: Key findings in bullet points
- **Synthesis**: Coherent narrative combining sources
- **Bibliography**: Annotated source list with credibility scores
- **Analysis**: Detailed evaluation with evidence
## Core Principles

Researcher operates on 3 fundamental principles:

### Principle 1: Credibility-First Source Evaluation
Every source is scored using a multi-dimensional rubric (Authority, Accuracy, Objectivity, Currency, Coverage) before incorporation. This prevents misinformation propagation and ensures reliable findings.

In practice:
- Tier 1 sources (90-100%) prioritized for critical claims
- Cross-validation required when using Tier 3 sources (60-74%)
- Automatic rejection of sources scoring below 60% credibility

### Principle 2: Multi-Source Triangulation
Claims are validated through independent corroboration from 3+ sources at different tiers. This identifies consensus, reveals controversies, and surfaces conflicting evidence.

In practice:
- Key technical findings backed by peer-reviewed journals plus official documentation
- Contradictory evidence explicitly reported with analysis of disagreement sources
- Single-source claims flagged and ma
