## Step 3: Analysis and Recommendations

### Synthesis (Manual or via knowledge-synthesizer.py)

#### Consensus Findings
Based on 5 sources (avg credibility: 88.8%):

1. **HNSW Algorithm Dominant** (4/5 sources)
   - Weaviate and Milvus use HNSW for indexing
   - Achieves 95%+ recall with <100ms latency
   - Industry standard for production RAG applications

2. **Managed vs Self-Hosted Trade-off** (5/5 sources)
   - **Managed** (Pinecone): No ops burden, predictable costs, vendor lock-in
   - **Self-Hosted** (Weaviate, Chroma): Full control, lower long-term cost, ops complexity

3. **Scale Considerations** (4/5 sources)
   - **<10M vectors**: Chroma (simple, lightweight, cost-effective)
   - **10M-100M vectors**: Weaviate, Milvus (balanced performance/cost)
   - **>100M vectors**: Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud (managed scaling)

#### Contradictions
None major. Minor difference in benchmark methodologies across sources.

#### Recommendation Matrix

| Requirement | Best Choice | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Prototype/MVP** | Chroma | Fast setup, in-memory mode, free |
| **Production <10M vectors** | Weaviate (self-hosted) | Open-source, hybrid search, active community |
| **Production >10M vectors** | Pinecone | Serverless scaling, minimal ops, proven reliability |
| **Cost-sensitive** | Weaviate (self-hosted) | No per-query fees, only infra costs |
| **Zero-ops** | Pinecone | Fully managed, automatic scaling |

## Step 4: Deliverables

### Files Generated
1. ✅ `vector-db-research.md` - Full research report with sources
2. ✅ `vector-db-research.json` - Structured data for programmatic access
3. ✅ `research-orchestrator.log` - Execution audit trail

### Decision Document
```yaml
# Vector Database Selection Decision
decision: "Weaviate (self-hosted for production, Chroma for prototyping)"

rationale:
  - Team has Kubernetes expertise for self-hosting
  - Dataset size: 5M vectors (fits Weaviate sweet spot)
  - Budget constraint: $500/month (Pinecone would cost $2,400/month)
  - Hybrid search required (vector + keyword)
  - Open-source preferred for long-term flexibility

evidence:
  - Source 2: "HNSW balances speed and memory efficiency"
  - Source 4: "Weaviate <100ms p95 latency for 1M vectors"
  - Cost calculation: 5M * 384 dims * 4 bytes = 7.3GB → Pinecone $700/month

next_steps:
  - Week 1: Prototype with Chroma (in-memory)
  - Week 2: Deploy Weaviate to staging (Kubernetes)
  - Week 3: Load test with 5M production-like vectors
  - Week 4: Migrate to production if benchmarks pass
```
