## Scenario

A startup is building a real-time analytics platform expected to handle 10,000+ writes/second and 50,000+ reads/second. They need to research and select the optimal database technology, considering performance, scalability, operational complexity, and cost.

## Problem Statement

The team needs to choose between:
- Traditional RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB)
- Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)

**Requirements:**
- High write throughput (10K+ writes/sec)
- High read throughput (50K+ reads/sec)
- Strong consistency for critical data
- Horizontal scalability
- Multi-region support
- Budget: <$5,000/month
- Team experience: PostgreSQL (strong), NoSQL (limited)

### Final Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): TimescaleDB Cloud**
**Rationale:**
1. Leverages team's PostgreSQL expertise (minimal learning curve)
2. Meets performance requirements (14K writes/sec, 60K reads/sec)
3. Optimized for time-series analytics use case
4. Reasonable cost ($1,900/mo within budget)
5. Managed service reduces operational burden
6. SQL capabilities for complex analytics queries

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Evaluate Migration to Cassandra**
**If traffic exceeds 50K writes/sec**, migrate to Cassandra:
- 6-month runway to build team expertise
- Hire experienced Cassandra engineer
- Run parallel systems during migration
- Discord's proven migration playbook

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with TimescaleDB for time-to-market
- Build abstract data access layer (easy to swap backends)
- Monitor growth trajectory closely
- Budget for Cassandra migration if needed

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Set up TimescaleDB Cloud, configure replication
2. **Week 3-4:** Build data access layer with abstraction
3. **Week 5-6:** Performance testing and optimization
4. **Month 2-3:** Production deployment with monitoring
5. **Month 3-6:** Continuous optimization, evaluate actual growth
6. **Month 6+:** Reassess based on real metrics

**Memory Storage:**

```bash
# Store comprehensive research in Memory-MCP
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store \
  --key "research/database-selection-analytics-platform" \
  --value "Recommended: TimescaleDB Cloud (Phase 1) → Cassandra (Phase 2). TimescaleDB: 14K writes/sec, $1.9K/mo, PostgreSQL-compatible. Cassandra: 15K writes/sec, linear scalability, 6mo learning curve. Decision factors: team expertise, cost, scalability path." \
  --metadata '{"project":"analytics-db-research","intent":"research","sources":8,"credibility":90.6,"decision":"timescaledb-then-cassandra"}'

npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "research-database-selection"
```

## Outcome

**What Was Discovered:**
- No single "perfect" database - trade-offs between performance, complexity, cost
- Team expertise significantly impacts operational success
- Phased approach reduces risk while maintaining flexibility
- Cost projections vary 3x between options ($1.1K-$3K/mo)
- Real-world case studies more valuable than vendor benchmarks

**How Multi-Source Synthesis Helped:**
1. **Quantitative Benchmarks:** Eliminated databases not meeting performance requirements
2. **Case Studies:** Provided real operational insights beyond benchmarks
3. **Cost Analysis:** Prevented budget surprises
4. **Operational Surveys:** Highlighted hidden complexity costs
5. **Triangulation:** Cross-validated findings across 8 independent sources
6. **Synthesis:** Created phased approach balancing multiple constraints

**Decision Impact:**
- Selected TimescaleDB for Phase 1 (time-to-market in 6 weeks)
- Built migration path to Cassandra for future scale
- Avoided costly mistakes (e.g., Cassandra too early, PostgreSQL too constrained)
- Budget-compliant solution ($1,900/mo < $5,000 budget)
- Team can execute with existing PostgreSQL expertise

**6-Month Follow-Up:**
- TimescaleDB handling 18K writes/sec, 65K reads/sec (exceeded expectations)
- Cost: $2,100/mo (10% over initial projection, still within budget)
- Team satisfaction: 9/10 (familiar SQL, good performance)
- Decision: Defer Cassandra migration, continue optimizing TimescaleDB

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multi-Source Research Reduces Risk:** 8 sources > 1 source for critical decisions
2. **Triangulation Validates:** Consensus across independent sources increases confidence
3. **Quantitative + Qualitative:** Combine benchmarks with real-world experience
4. **Cost Analysis Essential:** TCO includes infrastructure + operational complexity
5. **Phased Approaches Win:** Start simple, scale when needed
6. **Team Expertise Matters:** Operational complexity can outweigh performance gains
7. **Case Studies > Benchmarks:** Real production experience more valuable than synthetic tests
8. **Synthesis Creates Value:** Raw research → actionable phased strategy

**When to Apply This Pattern:**
- Major architectural decisions with long-term impact
- Choosing between multiple competing technologies
- High-stakes decisions requiring evidence-based justification
- When trade-offs span multiple dimensions (cost, performance, complexity)
- Decisions affecting team capacity and operational burden
- Budget-constrained environments requiring optimization
