## Orchestration Skill Guidelines

### When to Use This Skill
- **Multi-agent coordination** requiring centralized orchestration
- **Complex workflows** with multiple dependent tasks
- **Parallel execution** benefiting from concurrent agent spawning
- **Quality-controlled delivery** needing validation and consensus
- **Production workflows** requiring audit trails and state management

### When NOT to Use This Skill
- **Single-agent tasks** with no coordination requirements
- **Simple sequential work** completing in <30 minutes
- **Trivial operations** with no quality gates
- **Exploratory work** not needing formal orchestration

### Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *All agents complete successfully** with 100% task completion [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Coordination overhead minimal** (<20% of total execution time) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *No orphaned agents** - All spawned agents tracked and terminated [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *State fully recoverable** - Can resume from any failure point [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Quality gates pass** - All validation checks successful [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

### Edge Cases to Handle
- **Agent failures** - Detect and replace failed agents automatically
- **Timeout scenarios** - Configure per-agent timeout with escalation
- **Resource exhaustion** - Limit concurrent agents, queue excess work
- **Conflicting results** - Implement conflict resolution strategy
- **Partial completion** - Support incremental progress with rollback

### Guardrails (NEVER Violate)
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: lose orchestration state** - Persist to memory after each phase [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: track all agents** - Maintain real-time agent registry [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: cleanup resources** - Terminate agents and free memory on completion [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: skip validation** - Run quality checks before marking complete [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: handle errors** - Every orchestration step needs error handling [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

### Evidence-Based Validation
- **Verify all agent outputs** - Check actual results vs expected contracts
- **Validate execution order** - Confirm dependencies respected
- **Measure performance** - Track execution time vs baseline
- **Check resource usage** - Monitor memory, CPU, network during execution
- **Audit state consistency** - Verify orchestration state matches reality

## Overview

Bridge web interfaces with CLI workflows for seamless integration, enabling web applications to trigger CLI commands and CLI tools to display web interfaces.

## Agents & Responsibilities

### backend-dev
**Role:** Implement bridge API and integration logic
**Responsibilities:**
- Build REST API for CLI integration
- Implement WebSocket for real-time communication
- Handle authentication and security
- Manage state synchronization

### system-architect
**Role:** Design bridge architecture and patterns
**Responsibilities:**
- Design integration architecture
- Define communication protocols
- Plan security model
- Ensure scalability

## Phase 1: Design Bridge Architecture

### Objective
Design architecture for bidirectional web-CLI communication.

### Scripts

```bash
# Generate architecture diagram
npx claude-flow@alpha architect design \
  --type "web-cli-bridge" \
  --output bridge-architecture.json

# Define API specification
cat > api-spec.yaml <<EOF
