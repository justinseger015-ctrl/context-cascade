## Aspektual'naya Ramka Orkestratsii (Workflow State Tracking)

### Tipy Sostoyaniya (State Types)

**Stage States:**
- [SV:COMPLETED] Zaversheno - Stage/task complete, outputs validated
- [NSV:IN_PROGRESS] V protsesse - Active work, currently executing
- [BLOCKED] Blokirovano - Waiting for dependency to complete
- [PARALLEL] Parallel'no - Concurrent execution with other stages
- [FAILED] Provaleno - Stage failed, requires intervention
- [PENDING] Ozhidayet - Queued, not yet started

**Agent States:**
- [IDLE] Gotov - Ready for task assignment
- [WORKING] Rabotayet - Executing assigned task
- [WAITING] Zhdet - Blocked on external dependency
- [DONE] Zavershen - Task completed successfully
- [ERROR] Oshibka - Encountered error, needs recovery

**Transition Rules:**
- Phase N [SV] -> Phase N+1 [NSV] (all stages in phase complete)
- Stage [BLOCKED] -> Stage [NSV] (dependency resolved)
- Stage [FAILED] -> Stage [NSV] (retry/fix applied)
- Agent [IDLE] -> Agent [WORKING] -> Agent [DONE] (successful path)

### Vizualizatsiya Sostoyaniya (State Visualization)

WORKFLOW: enhanced-data-pipeline
  |
  +-- PHASE 1: Extract [SV:COMPLETED]
  |     +-- STAGE: extract-data [SV] (Agent: data-engineer [DONE])
  |
  +-- PHASE 2: Validate [NSV:IN_PROGRESS]
  |     +-- STAGE: validate-schema [NSV] (Agent: validator [WORKING])

## Keigo Wakugumi (Hierarchical Work Structure)

### Workflow Hierarchy

```
WORKFLOW (最上位)
  |
  +-- PHASE (重要段階) - Major sequential stage
        |
        +-- STAGE (小段階) - Sub-phase grouping
              |
              +-- TASK (作業) - Individual work item
                    |
                    +-- SUBTASK (細分) - Atomic operation
```

**Hierarchy Levels:**
1. **WORKFLOW** - Overall orchestration (e.g., "Production Deployment Pipeline")
2. **PHASE** - Sequential major stage (e.g., "Build", "Test", "Deploy")
3. **STAGE** - Within-phase grouping (e.g., "Unit Tests", "Integration Tests")
4. **TASK** - Assignable work unit (e.g., "Run Jest suite")
5. **SUBTASK** - Atomic operation (e.g., "Execute test file X")

### Dependency Visualization with Hierarchy

```
PHASE 1: Foundation Setup [SV]
  |-- TASK A: Research best practices [SV]
  |     |-- SUBTASK A.1: Search documentation [SV]
  |     |-- SUBTASK A.2: Analyze patterns [SV]

PHASE 2: Parallel Implementation [NSV]
  |-- TASK B: Backend API [NSV] (PARALLEL GROUP: implementation)
  |     |-- SUBTASK B.1: Define routes [SV]
  |     |-- SUBTASK B.2: Implement handlers [NSV]
  |
  |-- TASK C: Frontend UI [BLOCKED] (PARALLEL GROUP: implementation)
  |     |-- SUBTASK C.1: Component design [PENDING] (blocked by TASK B)
  |
  |-- TASK D: Database schema [PARALLEL] (PARALLEL GROUP: implementation)
        |-- SUBTASK D.1: Schema design [SV]
        |-- SUBTASK D.2: Migrations [NSV]

PHASE 3: Integration & Validation [PENDING]
  |-- TASK E: Integration testing [PENDING]
        |-- SUBTASK E.1: API tests [PENDING]
        |-- SUBTASK E.2: E2E tests [PENDING]

HIERARCHY PROPERTIES:
  - PHASE level: Sequential dependencies (Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3)
  - TASK level: Parallel within phase (TASK B || TASK C || TASK D)
  - SUBTASK level: Sequential within task (SUBTASK B.1 -> B.2)
```

## Orchestration Skill Guidelines

### When to Use This Skill
- **Multi-stage workflows** requiring sequential, parallel, or conditional execution
- **Complex pipelines** coordinating multiple micro-skills or agents
- **Iterative processes** with Codex sandbox testing and auto-fix loops
- **Multi-model routing** requiring intelligent AI selection per stage
- **Production workflows** needing GitHub integration and memory p
