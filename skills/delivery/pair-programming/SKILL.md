## When to Use This Skill

- **Learning Sessions**: Teaching or learning new technologies, patterns, or codebases
- **Complex Features**: Tackling features requiring deep collaboration
- **Debugging Sessions**: Pair debugging to solve difficult bugs faster
- **Code Reviews**: Real-time collaborative code review and refactoring
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Onboarding new team members or sharing expertise
- **TDD Sessions**: Test-driven development with navigator/driver roles

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Simple Tasks**: Trivial changes or routine maintenance
- **Independent Work**: Tasks requiring deep focus without interruption
- **Different Timezones**: Async code review more appropriate
- **Solo Learning**: Self-paced tutorials or experimentation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Both participants understand the implementation
- [ ] Code meets team quality standards
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Knowledge successfully shared
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Both participants satisfied with collaboration
- [ ] No blockers remaining

## Edge Cases to Handle

- **Skill Imbalance**: Significant experience gap between pair members
- **Disagreement**: Conflicting approaches or opinions
- **Fatigue**: Long sessions reducing effectiveness
- **Tool Differences**: Different IDE preferences or setups
- **Communication Styles**: Different working or communication preferences
- **Remote Pairing**: Latency, screen sharing issues, or connectivity problems

## Guardrails

- **NEVER** dominate the keyboard without switching roles
- **ALWAYS** switch driver/navigator roles every 25-30 minutes
- **NEVER** criticize or dismiss partner ideas
- **ALWAYS** explain reasoning for technical decisions
- **NEVER** skip breaks - take 5-10 minute breaks hourly
- **ALWAYS** commit working code at session end
- **NEVER** pair for more than 4-5 hours continuously

## Evidence-Based Validation

- [ ] Code compiles and runs successfully
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration)
- [ ] Both participants can explain implementation
- [ ] Code reviewed against team style guide
- [ ] Git commits follow team conventions
- [ ] Documentation reflects changes
- [ ] Security considerations addressed

Collaborative AI pair programming with intelligent role management, real-time quality monitoring, and comprehensive development workflows.

## What This Skill Does

This skill provides professional pair programming capabilities with AI assistance, supporting multiple collaboration modes, continuous verification, and integrated testing. It manages driver/navigator roles, performs real-time code review, tracks quality metrics, and ensures high standards through truth-score verification.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Multiple Modes**: Driver, Navigator, Switch, TDD, Review, Mentor, Debug
- **Real-Time Verification**: Automatic quality scoring with rollback on failures
- **Role Management**: Seamless switching between driver/navigator roles
- **Testing Integration**: Auto-generate tests, track coverage, continuous testing
- **Code Review**: Security scanning, performance analysis, best practice enforcement
- **Session Persistence**: Auto-save, recovery, export, and sharing

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Flow CLI installed (`npm install -g claude-flow@alpha`)
- Git repository (optional but recommended)

**Recommended:**
- Testing framework (Jest, pytest, etc.)
- Linter configured (ESLint, pylint, etc.)
- Code formatter (Prettier, Black, etc.)

## Quick Start

### Basic Session
```bash
# Start simple pair programming
claude-flow pair --start
```

### TDD Session
```bash
# Test-driven development
claude-flow pair --start \
  --mode tdd \
  --test-first \
  --coverage 90
```
