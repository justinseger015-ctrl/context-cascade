# GitHub Release Management Skill

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)

## Overview

Orchestrate end-to-end software release processes with intelligent agent coordination. This skill automates version bumping, changelog generation, release candidate testing, deployment orchestration, post-release validation, and rollback procedures for GitHub-hosted projects using comprehensive CI/CD integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when creating production releases with automated validation, coordinating multi-environment deployments (staging, production), generating release notes and changelogs automatically, managing semantic versioning across projects, implementing deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary), handling hotfix releases and emergency patches, or establishing release automation for new projects.

Use for both small single-repository releases and complex multi-service deployments, scheduled regular releases or on-demand deployments, and establishing release governance and compliance.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Swarm Topology

Initialize a **hierarchical topology** with release-manager as coordinator overseeing specialized deployment, testing, and documentation agents. Hierarchical structure ensures coordinated decision-making for critical release operations.

```bash
# Initialize hierarchical swarm for release management
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy specialized
```

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Release Manager** (`release-manager`): Top-level coordinator that oversees entire release process. Makes go/no-go decisions, coordinates deployment timing, manages rollback decisions, and ensures release quality standards. Acts as release captain.

**CI/CD Engineer** (`cicd-engineer`): Manages build pipelines, deployment automation, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment strategy execution. Handles technical deployment mechanics and environment configuration.

**Test Engineer** (`tester`): Validates release candidates through automated testing, regression testing, performance testing, and smoke testing. Verifies deployment success and monitors post-deployment health.

**Code Reviewer** (`reviewer`): Performs final code review of release branch, validates security compliance, checks for last-minute issues, and approves release artifacts.

**Documentation Writer** (`docs-writer`): Generates release notes, updates changelogs, creates deployment runbooks, and documents breaking changes. Ensures comprehensive release documentation.

## Release Management Workflows (SOP)

### Workflow 1: Standard Release (Major/Minor/Patch)

Execute full release cycle from version bump to production deployment.

**Phase 1: Pre-Release Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Initialize Release Swarm**

```bash
# Set up hierarchical release swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init topology=hierarchical maxAgents=8 strategy=specialized

# Spawn release team
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=release-manager
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coder name=cicd-engineer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=tester
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=analyst name=reviewer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=docs-writer
```

**Step 1.2: Determine Release Version**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Determine next release version:

  1. Fetch current version from package.json / Cargo.toml / VERSION file
  2. Analyze commits since last release using git log
  3. Classify changes: breaking|features|fixes|docs
  4. Apply semantic versioning rules:
     - Breaking changes → major version bump
     - New features → minor version bump
     - Bug fixes only → patch version bump
  5. Check for forced version override in environment

  Use scripts/semver.sh for version calculation
  Store version decision in memory: release/version
  Run hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description
