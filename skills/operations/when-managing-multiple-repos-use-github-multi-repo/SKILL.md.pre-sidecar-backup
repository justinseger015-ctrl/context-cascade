# GitHub Multi-Repository Management Skill

## Overview

Orchestrate complex operations across multiple related GitHub repositories with intelligent agent coordination. This skill enables consistent architecture enforcement, synchronized dependency updates, cross-repo refactoring, and coordinated releases for microservices, multi-package ecosystems, and distributed system architectures.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when managing microservices architectures spanning multiple repositories, coordinating changes across frontend/backend/infrastructure repos, migrating from monorepo to multi-repo structure, propagating breaking changes across dependent repositories, maintaining consistent coding standards across teams, synchronizing releases for multi-package systems, or enforcing architectural patterns across an organization.

Use for both small-scale coordination (2-5 repos) and large-scale orchestration (10+ repositories), one-time migrations or ongoing maintenance, and establishing governance for multi-repo ecosystems.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Swarm Topology

Initialize a **hierarchical topology** with a coordinator agent managing specialized worker agents. Hierarchical structure enables centralized decision-making for consistency while delegating specialized tasks to expert agents.

```bash
# Initialize hierarchical swarm for multi-repo coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy adaptive
```

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Hierarchical Coordinator** (`hierarchical-coordinator`): Top-level orchestrator that maintains global view of all repositories, makes architectural decisions, coordinates cross-repo operations, and ensures consistency. Acts as the single source of truth for multi-repo strategy.

**Repository Architect** (`repo-architect`): Analyzes repository structures, defines architectural patterns, creates dependency graphs, identifies coupling issues, and designs migration strategies. Maintains the architectural vision across repositories.

**Code Analyzer** (`code-analyzer`): Scans codebases for patterns, dependencies, and inconsistencies. Identifies code duplication across repos, tracks API contracts, and validates architectural compliance.

**CI/CD Engineer** (`cicd-engineer`): Manages build pipelines, deployment workflows, and release orchestration. Coordinates continuous integration across repositories and handles versioning strategies.

**Worker Agents** (spawned dynamically): Execute repository-specific tasks such as refactoring, testing, documentation updates, and dependency bumps. Scaled based on number of target repositories.

## Multi-Repository Workflows (SOP)

### Workflow 1: Cross-Repository Change Propagation

Propagate breaking changes, API updates, or architectural patterns across multiple repositories.

**Phase 1: Impact Analysis**

**Step 1.1: Initialize Hierarchical Coordination**

```bash
# Set up hierarchical swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init topology=hierarchical maxAgents=8 strategy=adaptive

# Spawn coordinator and specialists
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=hierarchical-coordinator
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=analyst name=repo-architect
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=analyst name=code-analyzer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coder name=cicd-engineer
```

**Step 1.2: Analyze Repository Dependencies**

Use `scripts/repo-graph.sh` to build dependency graph:

```bash
# Generate dependency graph across all repositories
bash scripts/repo-graph.sh build-graph \
  --repos "repo1,repo2,repo3" \
  --output "references/dependency-graph.dot"
```

Visualize the dependency graph to identify impact scope:

```bash
# Render graph visualization
dot -Tpng references/dependency-graph.dot -o dependency-graph.png
```

**Step 1.3: Identify Affected Repositories**

Launch coordinator to analyze impact:
