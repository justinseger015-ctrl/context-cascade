## CRITICAL: CI/CD SAFETY GUARDRAILS

**BEFORE any CI/CD operation, validate**:
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Deployment window approved (avoid peak hours)
- [ ] Health checks configured (readiness + liveness probes)
- [ ] Monitoring alerts active for deployment metrics
- [ ] Incident response team notified

**NEVER**:
- Deploy without rollback capability
- Skip environment-specific validation (dev -> staging -> prod)
- Ignore test failures in pipeline
- Deploy outside approved maintenance windows
- Bypass approval gates in production pipelines

**ALWAYS**:
- Use blue-green or canary deployments for zero-downtime
- Implement circuit breakers for cascading failure prevention
- Document deployment state changes in incident log
- Validate infrastructure drift before deployment
- Retain audit trail of all pipeline executions

**Evidence-Based Techniques for CI/CD**:
- **Plan-and-Solve**: Break deployment into phases (build -> test -> stage -> prod)
- **Self-Consistency**: Run identical tests across environments (consistency = reliability)
- **Least-to-Most**: Start with smallest scope (single pod -> shard -> region -> global)
- **Verification Loop**: After each phase, verify expected state before proceeding

## Quick Start

This skill provides comprehensive infrastructure orchestration capabilities including cloud provisioning, container orchestration, IaC management, deployment automation, and monitoring setup.

### Auto-Trigger Keywords
- "infrastructure", "cloud setup", "provision resources"
- "Kubernetes", "K8s", "container orchestration"
- "Terraform", "IaC", "infrastructure as code"
- "monitoring", "observability", "CI/CD pipeline"

## Core Capabilities

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Management
- Multi-cloud provisioning (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Configuration management (Ansible)

### 🚀 Deployment Automation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Blue-green and canary deployments
- Auto-scaling and load balancing
- Artifact management

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus/Grafana stack
- ELK stack for log aggregation
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
- Custom dashboards and alerting

## Quick Usage Examples

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Use the docker-containerization sub-skill
# See: docker-containerization/skill.md
# Automatically handles multi-stage builds, optimization, security scanning
```

### Kubernetes Setup
```bash
# Full production K8s cluster with monitoring
# Provisions managed cluster, deploys apps, sets up observability
# Refer to: examples/kubernetes-setup-example.md
```

### Terraform Infrastructure
```bash
# Multi-cloud infrastructure with GitOps
# Uses terraform-iac sub-skill for provisioning
# See: terraform-iac/skill.md and examples/terraform-infrastructure-example.md
```

## Agent Assignments

**Primary**: `cicd-engineer`, `backend-dev`, `system-architect`
**Supporting**: `code-analyzer`, `reviewer`, `tester`

## Workflow Phases

1. **Assessment** - Analyze requirements, design architecture
2. **Provisioning** - Deploy cloud resources with IaC
3. **Deployment Automation** - Set up CI/CD pipelines
4. **Monitoring** - Deploy observability stack
5. **Configuration** - Manage configs and secrets
6. **Testing** - Validate infrastructure and deployments

## Performance Targets

- Provisioning: < 10 minutes
- Deployment frequency: Multiple per day
- RTO: < 1 hour
- RPO: < 15 minutes
- Uptime: 99.9% SLA

## Best Practices

✅ Infrastructure as Code for all resources
✅ Multi-AZ/region for high availability
✅ Secrets management (never commit secrets)
✅ Regular security scanning and compliance
✅ Automated testing and disaster recovery drills
✅ Cost optimization and resource tagging

## Resources
