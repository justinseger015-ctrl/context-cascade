## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Deliver React features and architectures (SPA/SSR/SSG) with strong a11y/performance practices and reliable DX pipelines.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** React component/features, state management decisions, performance tuning, accessibility remediation, testing setup, SSR/Next.js work.
- **Negative:** Non-React frontends (route to frontend-specialists) or generic prompt rewrites (prompt-architect).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: maintain `SKILL.md`, `readme`, `examples/`, `tests/`, and `resources/`.
- Constraint clarity: HARD/SOFT/INFERRED (runtime: browser/SSR, data fetching, bundle budgets, a11y targets, release cadence).
- Quality gates: lint/format, type-check, unit/integration/e2e as needed, a11y checks, performance budgets (CWV).
- Confidence ceilings enforced (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake**: Capture framework (React/Next), routing needs, design assets, performance/a11y targets.
2. **Design**: Choose state/data strategy (React Query, Redux, context), component contracts, and error/loading states.
3. **Implementation**: Build components with semantic HTML, ARIA correctness, code-splitting, memoization, and logging.
4. **Validation**: Run lint/format/type/test; measure CWV and a11y (axe/lighthouse); regression snapshots if applicable.
5. **Delivery**: Document changes, monitoring hooks, feature flags/rollback, and deployment steps.

### Output Format
- Request summary + constraints.
- Component/architecture plan and rationale.
- Validation results (tests + perf/a11y metrics) and risks.
- Confidence with ceiling.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Constraints confirmed; design assets referenced.
- [ ] Bundle/perf/a11y budgets defined and measured.
- [ ] Lint/format/type/test run; snapshots updated if used.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.
