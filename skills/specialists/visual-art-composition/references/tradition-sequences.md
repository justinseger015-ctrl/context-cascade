## How to Use This Reference

Each tradition's cognitive sequence represents the **order of questions** an artist in that tradition asks. When combining traditions, you can:

1. Use one tradition's sequence as primary, another's as validation
2. Interleave questions from multiple traditions
3. Use one tradition's sequence for composition, another's for color
4. Apply different sequences to different areas of the same image

## Combining Sequences

### Method 1: Primary + Validation
Use one tradition's sequence fully, then validate with another's primary question.

Example: 
- Primary: Byzantine sequence (all 7 steps)
- Validation: "Does this have qi yun?" (Chinese)
- Result: Byzantine icon with living energy

### Method 2: Parallel Processing
Apply different sequences to different elements.

Example:
- Figure: Yoruba itutu sequence
- Background: Japanese ma sequence
- Color: Chinese emotion-first sequence
- Result: Composed figure in breathing space with emotionally-chosen colors

### Method 3: Conflict Resolution
Use tensions between sequences as creative fuel.

Example:
- Futurist sequence demands motion
- Wabi-sabi sequence demands stillness
- Resolution: Motion blur at edges, stillness at center
