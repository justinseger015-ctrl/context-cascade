## 5-Minute Workflow

### Step 1: Emotional Core (30 seconds)
What should the viewer FEEL?
- [ ] Calm, peaceful, serene
- [ ] Tense, anxious, uneasy
- [ ] Energetic, dynamic, excited
- [ ] Melancholic, sad, contemplative
- [ ] Awed, overwhelmed, sublime
- [ ] Composed, noble, dignified
- [ ] Curious, intellectually engaged

### Step 2: Pick 3 Dimensions (1 minute)
Choose the most impactful for your intent:

**For CALM**: `ma_emptiness` + `deliberate_incomplete` + `wabi_melancholy`
**For TENSE**: `horror_vacui` + `emotional_distortion` + `tenebrism_extreme`
**For ENERGETIC**: `motion_fragmented` + `dynamic_sequence` + `high_key_luminous`
**For AWE**: `linear_perspective` (vast) + `sublime_awe` + `hierarchical_importance`
**For COMPOSED**: `itutu_cool` + `polished_complete` + `serene_detachment`

### Step 3: Add One Tension (30 seconds)
Pick ONE productive collision:
- Fill vs. empty
- Perfect vs. imperfect
- Motion vs. stillness
- Hot emotion vs. cool expression
- Modern content vs. ancient structure

### Step 4: Define Absences (30 seconds)
What will you NOT include?
- If using ma: no horror vacui, no dense pattern
- If using wabi-sabi: no symmetry, no polish, no bright saturation
- If using Byzantine: no optical perspective, no naturalistic shadow
- If using futurism: no stillness, no vertical/horizontal stability

### Step 5: Generate Prompt (2 minutes)
Template:

```
[SUBJECT] in/at [SETTING], rendered with [TRADITION 1] [SPECIFIC TECHNIQUE]
combined with [TRADITION 2] [SPECIFIC TECHNIQUE]. 

[DIMENSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION 1]: [how it manifests]
[DIMENSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION 2]: [how it manifests]
[DIMENSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION 3]: [how it manifests]

Productive tension: [TENSION PAIR] resolved through [RESOLUTION STRATEGY].

Palette: [COLOR PHILOSOPHY] approach—[specific colors and saturation strategy].
Value structure: [VALUE APPROACH]—[specific light/dark distribution].
Emotional register: [EMOTION]—[how it manifests in form/expression].

Deliberate absences: [WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED].
```

## Cheat Sheet: Common Combinations

### "Serene Japanese"
- Space: `ma_emptiness`
- Completion: `deliberate_incomplete`
- Emotion: `wabi_melancholy`
- Value: `notan_two_value`
- Color: Low saturation, high brightness, cool grays
- Absent: Density, polish, bright color, symmetry

### "Byzantine Sacred"
- Spatial: `reverse_perspective`
- Idealization: `hieratic_stylization`
- Emotion: `serene_detachment`
- Value: `flat_unmodeled`
- Color: Symbolic coded, gold = heaven
- Absent: Optical perspective, naturalistic shadow, secular content

### "Futurist Energy"
- Spatial: `motion_fragmented`
- Temporal: `dynamic_sequence`
- Viewer: `enveloping_immersion`
- Value: `high_key_luminous` with vibrating complements
- Color: High saturation, complementary adjacency
- Absent: Stillness, stability, single moment, muted tones

### "Yoruba Cool"
- Emotion: `itutu_cool`
- Completion: `generative_unfinished`
- Meaning: `form_has_agency`
- Idealization: Balance between polished and alive
- Surface: Smooth, dark, cool sheen
- Absent: Strain, grimace, chaotic expression

### "Documentary Truth"
- Purpose: `social_political`
- Idealization: `truth_to_nature`
- Hierarchy: `equal_treatment`
- Value: Natural lighting, unstaged
- Color: As-found, unmanipulated
- Absent: Idealization, dramatic lighting, staged composition

## Emergency Fixes

### Problem: Image feels flat/boring
**Add**: One tension pair (e.g., motion in stillness)
**Add**: Strong notan structure
**Add**: Single point of high saturation

### Problem: Image feels chaotic
**Remove**: One dimension (simplify)
**Add**: More deliberate absences
**Add**: Clearer focal hierarchy
**Check**: Are dimensions conflicting rather than tensioning?

### Problem: Image feels derivative/clichéd
**Add**: Cross-cultural tension (e.g., Byzantine structure + modern content)
**Replace**: Expected tradition with unexpected one
**Ask**: What would an artist from [opposite tradition] do here?

### Problem: Colors feel wrong
**Check**: Are you using emotion-first or hue-first?
**Check**: Is saturation creating unintended hierarchy?
**Check**: Are grays carrying correct temperature?
**Reset**: What should viewer FEEL? Work backward from that.

## Validation Questions

Before finalizing, ask:

1. **Could a single-tradition artist write this?**
   - If YES: Add another dimension or tension
   - If NO: Good—this is novel combination

2. **Is the emotional intent clear?**
   - If UNCLEAR: Simplify dimensions, strengthen emotional register

3. **Are absences coherent?**
   - If CONFLICTING: Choose which tradition's absences dominate

4. **Is there at least one productive tension?**
   - If NO: Image may be static; add one collision

5. **Does notan structure hold?**
   - If UNCLEAR: Sketch in two values before proceeding

## Example: Full Quick Workflow

**Goal**: Image of a programmer working late, feeling existential weight

**Step 1 - Emotion**: Melancholic, contemplative, slight anxiety

**Step 2 - Dimensions**:
- `emotional_distortion` (Expressionist angles)
- `tenebrism_extreme` (swallowed in darkness except screen)
- `horror_vacui` (code filling every surface)

**Step 3 - Tension**: 
Horror vacui (dense code everywhere) + single light source (screen)

**Step 4 - Absences**:
- No natural daylight
- No cheerful colors
- No stable verticals (everything slightly tilted)
- No completion (code trails off, unfinished)

**Step 5 - Prompt**:
> A programmer at a desk, rendered with Expressionist angular distortion—figure elongated, posture hunched, face lit only by screen glow. Tenebrism: the room is swallowed in near-black except the monitor's cold light catching face and hands. Horror vacui fills every surface: code scrolls across all walls, streams across desk, reflects in glasses—text everywhere but none legible. The figure's proportions are Kirchner-stretched: too-long fingers on keyboard, shoulders angular, spine curved. Color: cold blue-white from screen against warm blacks everywhere else; no other color. Monitor is the only light source—harsh, unforgiving. The code-covered walls tilt slightly inward (reverse perspective pressure). Emotional register: existential weight—the quiet terror of infinite tasks, the solitude of late-night work. Deliberate absences: no daylight, no other humans, no warm colors, no stability, no completion—the code never ends.
