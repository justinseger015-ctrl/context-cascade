## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Ship resilient ML systems: architecture design, training pipelines, optimization, and deployment readiness with explicit guardrails.

### Triggers
- **Positive:** Implementing architectures, training/tuning models, fixing training instabilities, optimizing inference, translating research into code.
- **Negative:** Pure data analysis (route to data scientist) or root-cause training incidents (prefer `ml-training-debugger` first).

### Guardrails
- Structure-first: maintain `SKILL.md`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `resources/`, and `agents/`; backfill missing docs before execution.
- Constraint hygiene (prompt-architect): collect HARD/SOFT/INFERRED requirements (targets, latency, memory, compliance).
- Validation discipline (skill-forge): adversarial tests for data leakage, class imbalance, and distribution shift; always run baseline + ablations.
- Evidence + confidence ceiling: report metrics with data splits and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)` (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).
- Safety: never evaluate on train data; never touch test set until final validation; document assumptions and monitoring plan.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake & Goals**
   - Identify objective, metrics (accuracy/F1/RMSE/latency), constraints (hardware, model size, privacy).
   - Confirm data availability, provenance, and allowed tooling.
2. **Design**
   - Choose architecture and loss/optimization strategy; plan data splits and augmentation; define monitoring signals.
   - Draft experiment plan with baseline + targeted variants.
3. **Implementation**
   - Build reproducible pipelines (seed control, config versioning); implement training loop with logging (TensorBoard/MLflow/W&B).
   - Enforce safe defaults: mixed precision gated by tests, gradient clipping where appropriate, checkpointing with retention policy.
4. **Validation**
   - Run baseline then ablations; check class-wise metrics, calibration, and drift sensitivity.
   - Profile training/inference latency; quantify memory footprint.
   - Security checks: adversarial probes, prompt/feature injection handling for LLM/vision models.
5. **Deployment Readiness**
   - Package artifacts (model weights, config, preprocessing, schema); provide rollout + rollback steps.
   - Attach monitoring plan (drift, performance, cost) and ownership.

### Output Format
- Request summary and constraints (HARD/SOFT/INFERRED).
- Architecture + data plan, experiment matrix, and validation results.
- Deployment checklist with monitoring hooks and rollback path.
- Confidence statement with ceiling and evidence source.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Data splits clean (no leakage) and documented.
- [ ] Baseline + ablations executed; metrics reported with variance.
- [ ] Latency/memory within targets; profiling attached.
- [ ] Safety checks run (bias, drift, adversarial probes) or noted N/A.
- [ ] Reproducibility ensured (seeds/configs/versioning).
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated.
