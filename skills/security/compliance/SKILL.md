## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when conducting compliance audits, implementing regulatory controls, preparing for certification audits, validating GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2/PCI-DSS/ISO27001 adherence, or documenting security and privacy practices for regulated industries.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use for non-regulated applications, internal tools without compliance requirements, proof-of-concept projects, or general security audits (use security-analyzer instead). Avoid using for unauthorized compliance testing of third-party systems.

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] All applicable regulatory requirements identified with evidence mapping [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Compliance gaps documented with severity ratings (critical/high/medium/low) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Controls implemented with validation tests (automated where possible) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Evidence collection automated with audit trail timestamps [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Remediation plans created for all gaps with assigned owners [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Compliance score >90% for target framework [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Zero critical violations remaining before certification [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases & Challenges

- Multi-jurisdiction compliance (GDPR + CCPA + local regulations)
- Legacy systems without compliance documentation
- Third-party services requiring BAA/DPA agreements
- Encrypted data requiring key escrow for compliance
- Real-time compliance monitoring vs periodic audits
- Conflicting requirements between frameworks
- Continuous compliance vs point-in-time certification

## Guardrails (CRITICAL SECURITY RULES)
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: implement compliance controls on unauthorized systems [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: collect or store PII/PHI without proper encryption and access controls [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: bypass security controls to achieve compliance scores [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: generate false compliance evidence or documentation [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: document evidence collection methods with timestamps [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate controls through independent testing [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: obtain legal review for compliance interpretations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: maintain audit trails for all compliance activities [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: use encryption at rest and in transit for sensitive data [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: implement least-privilege access for compliance tools [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

All compliance findings MUST be validated through:
1. **Automated scanning** - Use compliance scanning tools with documented results
2. **Manual verification** - Independent review of at least 20% of automated findings
3. **Evidence collection** - Screenshots, logs, configurations with timestamps
4. **Cross-validation** - Multiple methods confirm same finding (tool + manual + audit)
5. **Expert review** - Compliance specialist validates critical findings
6. **Remediation testing** - Verify fixes resolve violations without introducing new gaps
