### L1 Improvement
- Converted the documentation hub to an English-first SOP with structure-first guardrails and explicit routing to doc-generator.
- Added constraint extraction (Prompt Architect) and validation hooks (Skill Forge) with confidence ceilings.
- Clarified outputs: user-facing docs, API references, and inline comment updates.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Coordinate documentation requests—planning, drafting, and validation—while delegating inline/README/API generation to the `when-documenting-code-use-doc-generator` subskill when appropriate.

### Trigger Conditions
- **Positive:** new/updated README, API docs, inline comments, changelogs, or architecture notes.
- **Negative:** code-only fixes without doc impact; route to implementation skills first.

### Guardrails
- Structure-first docs: `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `QUICK-REFERENCE.md`, examples/tests placeholders.
- Use Prompt Architect constraint extraction (audience, scope, domain terminology, success criteria).
- Enforce confidence ceilings and cite sources/observations; avoid hallucinated APIs.
- Memory tagging for doc runs; keep versioned outputs.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intent & Audience** – Identify doc type (README/API/inline/guide), target audience, and scope; route to subskill if generation-heavy.
2. **Source Collection** – Gather code references, existing docs, decisions, and style guides.
3. **Drafting** – Produce structured doc with headings, task flows, and examples; maintain progressive disclosure.
4. **Validation** – Check accuracy against code, run doc lints if available, and ensure consistency with terminology.
5. **Delivery** – Summarize changes, open risks, and follow-ups; include confidence with ceiling syntax and memory keys.

### Output Format
- Doc type and scope, key sources, and assumptions.
- Drafted content or updated sections with diffs/paths.
- Validation notes (accuracy checks, style compliance).
- Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY) and memory namespace used.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Audience and intent confirmed; routing noted.
- [ ] Sources cited and verified against code.
- [ ] Style/terminology aligned; links and paths validated.
- [ ] Memory tagged and artifacts stored.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling declared.

### Integration
- **Subskill:** `when-documenting-code-use-doc-generator` for detailed generation flows.
- **Memory MCP:** `skills/tooling/documentation/{project}/{timestamp}` for drafts and approvals.
- **Hooks:** Skill Forge latency bounds respected for doc generation and review.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – SOP aligned to Prompt Architect constraint-first drafting and Skill Forge validation gates.
