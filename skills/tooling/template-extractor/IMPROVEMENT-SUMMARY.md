## Improvements Applied

### 1. Added Advanced Techniques Section (Tier 2 - Essential)
New section with 4 advanced techniques:
- Multi-Document Template Extraction
- Conditional Formatting Extraction (Excel)
- Cross-Reference Preservation
- Theme Inheritance Analysis

**Impact**: Provides advanced users with techniques beyond basic extraction.

### 2. Added Cross-Skill Coordination Section (Tier 3 - Integration)
Documented relationships with 15+ other skills:
- Upstream Skills: reverse-engineering-quick, file-analyzer, gemini-search
- Downstream Skills: doc-generator, pptx-generation, api-development
- Parallel Skills: skill-creator-agent, functionality-audit
- Coordination Pattern with Memory MCP integration

**Impact**: Makes skill discoverable and usable in larger workflows.

### 3. Added Input/Output Contracts Section (Tier 3 - Integration)
Formal contracts added to YAML frontmatter and documented:
- Input Contract: Required (document_path, output_directory) + Optional (verification_mode, asset_extraction, detail_level)
- Output Contract: Guaranteed (5 files) + Conditional (3 files)
- Quality Guarantees: 4 explicit guarantees

**Impact**: Enables programmatic validation and contract-based execution.

### 4. Added Troubleshooting Section (Tier 4 - Closure)
8 common problems with causes and solutions:
- Unzip fails with "invalid ZIP file"
- Extracted colors don't match visual appearance
- Missing fonts in recreation
- Page layout differs after recreation
- Table borders missing or incorrect
- Excel conditional formatting not extracted
- Verification shows <95% fidelity
- Automation script fails on PPTX/XLSX

**Impact**: Reduces support burden and enables self-service problem resolution.

### 5. Added Completion Verification Section (Tier 4 - Closure)
Comprehensive checklist with 5 phases:
- Phase 1: Document Analysis (4 checkboxes)
- Phase 2: Systematic Extraction (8 checkboxes)
- Phase 3: Asset Handling (3 checkboxes)
- Phase 4: Output Generation (5 checkboxes)
- Phase 5: Quality Verification (9 checkboxes)
- Final Validation (5 checkboxes)
Total: 34 verification checkboxes

**Impact**: Provides clear completion criteria and quality gates.

### 6. Strengthened Conclusion (Tier 4 - Closure)
Enhanced from generic summary to compelling call-to-action:
- Key Takeaways: 3 specific insights derived from Core Principles
- When to Use: 4 concrete use cases
- When NOT to Use: 3 anti-use-cases
- Closing statement emphasizing value proposition

**Impact**: Leaves reader with clear understanding of skill value.

### 7. Enhanced Core Principles (Quality Improvement)
Strengthened "In Practice" sections with more concrete examples:
- Principle 1: Added specific file paths and XML elements
- Principle 2: Expanded output format descriptions
- Principle 3: Added concrete verification metrics

**Impact**: Makes principles more actionable and less abstract.

## Files Modified

- C:/Users/17175/claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/skills/tooling/template-extractor/SKILL.md (updated)
- C:/Users/17175/claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/skills/tooling/template-extractor/SKILL.md.backup (original backup)
- C:/Users/17175/claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/skills/tooling/template-extractor/IMPROVEMENT-SUMMARY.md (this file)

## Next Steps

1. Test skill with real document extraction workflow
2. Validate Input/Output Contracts with programmatic invocation
3. Add skill to production skill registry
4. Monitor usage metrics in Memory MCP
5. Iterate based on user feedback

## Validation

Run audit again to confirm 100% Tier 1-4 compliance:
```bash
node scripts/audit-skill.js skills/tooling/template-extractor/SKILL.md
```

Expected output:
- Tier 1: 100% COMPLETE
- Tier 2: 100% COMPLETE  
- Tier 3: 75% COMPLETE (Recursive Improvement section optional)
- Tier 4: 100% COMPLETE
- Overall: COMPLETE (95% - production ready)
