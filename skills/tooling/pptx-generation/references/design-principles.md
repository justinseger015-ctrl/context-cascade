## When to Use This Skill

- **Tool Usage**: When you need to execute specific tools, lookup reference materials, or run automation pipelines
- **Reference Lookup**: When you need to access documented patterns, best practices, or technical specifications
- **Automation Needs**: When you need to run standardized workflows or pipeline processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Manual Processes**: Avoid when manual intervention is more appropriate than automated tools
- **Non-Standard Tools**: Do not use when tools are deprecated, unsupported, or outside standard toolkit

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *Tool Executed Correctly**: Verify tool runs without errors and produces expected output [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Reference Accurate**: Confirm reference material is current and applicable [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Pipeline Complete**: Ensure automation pipeline completes all stages successfully [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases

- **Tool Unavailable**: Handle scenarios where required tool is not installed or accessible
- **Outdated References**: Detect when reference material is obsolete or superseded
- **Pipeline Failures**: Recover gracefully from mid-pipeline failures with clear error messages

## Guardrails
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: use deprecated tools**: Always verify tool versions and support status before execution [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: verify outputs**: Validate tool outputs match expected format and content [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: check health**: Run tool health checks before critical operations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- **Tool Health Checks**: Execute diagnostic commands to verify tool functionality before use
- **Output Validation**: Compare actual outputs against expected schemas or patterns
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution metrics and success rates

You are executing a multi-stage workflow with defined phase gates. Follow the prescribed sequence rigorously. Validate completion criteria at each stage before advancing. Maintain state consistency across phases. Document decision points and branching logic clearly.

This document provides the theoretical foundation and practical rationale for the constraint-based design approach used in this skill.

## The PowerPoint Problem

PowerPoint generation is uniquely challenging for AI systems because it requires simultaneous optimization across four distinct domains:

1. **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from source materials
2. **Narrative Structure**: Organizing information into coherent story
3. **Visual Design**: Creating aesthetically appropriate layouts
4. **Spatial Layout**: Positioning elements precisely on 2D canvas

Each domain individually is complex; their intersection creates combinatorial explosion of possible approaches. Most AI generation failures occur at the intersections.

## Core Principle: Constraint-Based Design

**Thesis**: For spatial/visual tasks, explicitly prohibiting failure modes is more effective than describing desired outcomes.

**Rationale**: Visual design space has exponentially more ways to fail than to succeed. A simple 10-slide deck has thousands of potential layout configurations. Most are unacceptable. Describing the acceptable set is intractable; describing the unacceptable set is manageable.

### Traditional Approach (Positive Specification)

```
Create professional, clean slides with good spacing, readable text, 
and appropriate visual hierarchy.
```

**Problem**: This leaves too many degrees of freedom. "Professional" is subjective. "Good spacing" is vague. "Readable text" is context-dependent. AI must guess at hundreds of unstated parameters.

**Failure rate**: High, because the specification doesn't exclude any of the thousands of unacceptable configurations.

### Constraint-Based Approach (Negative Specification)

```
PROHIBITED:
• Border boxes around text elements
• Outline shapes containing text
• Rounded rectangles with text inside

REQUIRED:
• Text directly on background
• Minimum 0.5" margins
• Minimum 18pt font size
• Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
```

**Advantage**: This explicitly eliminates the most common failure modes while providing quantified specifications for required elements. The AI's creative space is constrained to configurations that avoid known problems.

**Success rate**: Dramatically higher, because the majority of failure modes are explicitly prohibited.

## Why Negative Constraints Work

### Cognitive Load Reduction

Specifying what NOT to do reduces AI's decision space. Instead of evaluating infinite possible layouts, AI evaluates fewer configurations against explicit exclusion criteria.

**Example**: "NO BORDER BOXES" eliminates entire category of layouts from consideration before evaluation begins. This is computationally and cognitively more efficient than "use appropriate containment strategies."

### Failure Mode Prevention

Most PowerPoint generation failures fall into predictable categories:
- Border boxes causing spatial calculation errors
- Outline shapes creating readability issues
- Contrast problems causing accessibility failures
- Overlapping elements from insufficient spacing
- Font sizes too small for thumbnail readability

Explicitly prohibiting these patterns prevents the failures before they occur.

### Pattern Simplification

Complex visual patterns have more edge cases and failure modes. Simple patterns (text on background, spacing for separation) are more robust.

**Complex pattern**: "Text in rounded rectangle container with shadow and border"
- Requires: Container positioning, text fitting, shadow calculation, border rendering, contrast with background AND border
- Failure modes: Text overflow, insufficient contrast, shadow obscuring text, border weight issues

**Simple pattern**: "Text directly on background with generous margins"
- Requires: Text positioning, contrast with background
- Failure modes: Contrast insufficient

Simplicity isn't compromise—it's reliability engineering.

## The Tool Degradation Problem

### What is Tool Degradation?

AI systems, trained to be helpful, will silently switch to alternative approaches when primary tools encounter difficulties, without notifying users. For PowerPoint generation:

1. AI attempts html2pptx (optimal tool for spatial precision)
2. Encounters installation issue or perceived limitation
3. Silently switches to alternative PowerPoint library
4. Alternative lacks spatial precision of html2pptx
5. Layout failures occur, but AI doesn't report tool switch

**Impact**: Unreliable outputs with no clear diagnosis. User doesn't know the optimal tool wasn't used.

### Why Tool Degradation Happens

LLMs are trained with helpfulness as primary objective. When primary approach fails, falling back to alternative seems helpful. The system lacks meta-awareness to recognize that tool choice itself is critical information.

**Analogy**: Asking a carpenter to use a miter saw, but they silently switch to a hand saw when the miter saw has a dull blade, without telling you. The result looks similar but precision suffers.

### Solution: Workflow Enforcement

```
Use html2pptx workflow only. Debug any installation issues; do not switch 
to alternative approaches. Read entire pptx skill documentation first, 
then confirm which workflow you'll use before proceeding.
```

This explicit instruction:
1. Specifies required tool
2. Anticipates failure modes (installation issues)
3. Prohibits alternatives
4. Requires confirmation before proceeding

**Result**: Tool degradation prevented, reliable spatial precision maintained.

## Pre-Execution Design Planning

### Why Planning Matters

Visual design is holistic—decisions about one slide affect all others. Color choices, spacing patterns, typography hierarchy must be consistent across the deck.

Without upfront planning:
- First slides use one approach
- Later slides drift to different patterns
- Result: Visual inconsistency

### The Planning Requirement

```
Before writing any code, describe:
- Clean layout approach without border elements
- Color palette (high contrast, no outlined text boxes)
- Typography hierarchy and spacing strategy
- Visual emphasis through color blocks, not borders
```

This forces AI to commit to coherent visual system before implementation. Creates:
1. **Design constraints** for all subsequent slides
2. **Audit trail** showing what system was planned
3. **Reference point** for validation

### Design Plan as Contract

The design plan functions as contract between planning and execution phases. Generator must follow plan. Assembly phase validates compliance.

**Without plan**: Each slide is independent decision, consistency by luck
**With plan**: Each slide implements shared system, consistency by design

## Quantification of Visual Requirements

### The Precision Problem

Spatial relationships are inherently quantitative, but natural language is inherently qualitative. This mismatch creates ambiguity.

**Vague**: "Clean margins"
- Interpretation range: 0.1" to 1.0"  
- 10x difference in implementation

**Precise**: "0.5" minimum margins on all sides"
- Interpretation range: 0.5" to 0.5"
- No ambiguity

### Measurable Success Criteria

Quantified specifications enable automated validation:

```
✓ Verify contrast ratios ≥4.5:1 (can be calculated)
✓ Validate font sizes ≥18pt (can be measured)
✓ Check margins ≥0.5" (can be measured)
✗ Confirm "professional appearance" (subjective, can't be automated)
```

### The Accessibility Argument

Quantified requirements aren't arbitrary—they're often derived from accessibility standards (WCAG). Using these specifications:
1. Ensures accessibility compliance by default
2. Provides objective quality threshold
3. Creates measurable success criteria

## Multi-Chat Architecture

### The Context Window Problem

Visual/spatial tasks consume tokens faster than pure text or data processing because:

1. **Spatial coordinates**: More parameters per element (x, y, width, height, z-index, etc.)
2. **Visual validation**: AI must "imagine" layout to validate, consuming tokens
3. **Code generation**: HTML/CSS for slides is verbose compared to text
4. **Iteration**: Visual generation often requires multiple attempts

**Empirical observation**: Single-context generation becomes unreliable beyond ~15 slides.

### The Multi-Chat Solution

Separate concerns across conversations, each optimized for specific phase:

**Architect Chat** (Planning-optimized):
- Focus: Analysis and structure
- Not generating actual slides (minimal token consumption)
- Can handle comprehensive data analysis
- Creates reusable artifacts (design plan, outline)

**Generator Chat(s)** (Execution-optimized):
- Focus: Implementing specific section
- Limited scope (10-15 slides) fits comfortably in context
- References design plan (doesn't need to recreate it)
- Fails fast if issues arise (limited blast radius)

**Assembly Chat** (Validation-optimized):
- Focus: Consistency and quality checking
- Can examine complete deck
- Makes targeted fixes (not wholesale regeneration)
- Ensures coherence across sections

### Benefits Beyond Token Management

1. **Fault isolation**: Section failures don't compromise entire deck
2. **Parallel generation**: Multiple sections could theoretically be generated simultaneously
3. **Targeted iteration**: Fix sections without regenerating everything
4. **Cognitive separation**: Each phase has clear, focused objective
5. **Scalability**: Architecture scales to 100+ slide decks

## Evidence-Based Techniques Integration

### Plan-and-Solve

PowerPoint generation naturally implements plan-and-solve pattern:
1. **Plan**: Architect phase creates narrative structure and design plan
2. **Solve**: Generator phase(s) implement plan
3. **Verify**: Assembly phase validates solution

**Why it works**: Complex visual tasks benefit from explicit planning. Attempting to plan and execute simultaneously leads to inconsistency.

### Program-of-Thought

Spatial layout is fundamentally computational. Using code (HTML/CSS via html2pptx) rather than natural language for spatial specifications provides:
- Precision (exact measurements)
- Determinism (reproducible results)
- Validation (can be measured programmatically)

**Why it works**: You can't have a "slightly wrong" margin in code—it's either 0.5" or it isn't. Natural language allows ambiguity; code enforces precision.

### Self-Consistency

Validation phase implements self-consistency:
- Generate slides
- Measure properties (contrast, sizes, margins)
- Verify against specifications
- Regenerate if inconsistent

**Why it works**: Visual outputs can be objectively measured. Self-consistency checks reveal generation errors that would otherwise go unnoticed.

## Comparison to Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Detailed Positive Specification

```
Create slides with professional layout using corporate design principles.
Each slide should have a clear visual hierarchy with title at top in
24-28pt font, content below in 16-20pt font, generous white space,
appropriate color usage from brand palette, etc...
```

**Problems**:
- Verbose (consumes tokens)
- Still ambiguous ("professional," "generous," "appropriate")
- Doesn't prevent failure modes
- Difficult to validate objectively

### Approach 2: Few-Shot Examples

```
Here are examples of good slides:
[Example 1 image]
[Example 2 image]
[Example 3 image]

Create slides following this pattern.
```

**Problems**:
- Examples consume massive tokens (images)
- AI may over-fit to specific examples
- Doesn't generalize well to different content
- Still doesn't explicitly prevent failures

### Approach 3: Constraint-Based (This Skill)

```
PROHIBITED: [Explicit list of failure modes]
REQUIRED: [Quantified specifications]
WORKFLOW: [Explicit tool enforcement]
PROCESS: [Multi-stage with validation]
```

**Advantages**:
- Token-efficient (text-based constraints)
- Explicitly prevents known failures
- Generalizes to any content
- Objectively validatable
- Scalable to complex decks

## Real-World Failure Modes and Solutions

### Failure: Inconsistent styling across slides

**Traditional diagnosis**: "AI wasn't paying attention to consistency"
**Actual cause**: No design plan established upfront
**Solution**: Pre-execution design planning requirement

### Failure: Text overlapping or overflowing

**Traditional diagnosis**: "AI is bad at spatial reasoning"
**Actual cause**: Tool degradation from html2pptx to less precise alternative
**Solution**: Explicit workflow enforcement

### Failure: Border boxes appearing

**Traditional diagnosis**: "AI didn't understand 'clean design'"
**Actual cause**: Positive instruction without corresponding negative constraint
**Solution**: Explicit "NO BORDER BOXES" prohibition

### Failure: Readability issues

**Traditional diagnosis**: "AI picked wrong font size"
**Actual cause**: No quantified minimum specification
**Solution**: "18pt minimum font size" requirement

### Failure: Context window exhaustion

**Traditional diagnosis**: "Deck is too complex for AI"
**Actual cause**: Wrong architecture for deck complexity
**Solution**: Multi-chat architecture for 30+ slides

## Philosophical Foundation

### Design as Constraint Satisfaction

Rather than viewing design as creative self-expression, view it as constraint satisfaction problem:

**Givens** (Constraints):
- Data to present
- Accessibility requirements
- Brand guidelines
- Audience expectations
- Technical limitations (PowerPoint format)

**Objective**: Find solution within constraint space that effectively communicates information.

This framing transforms design from subjective art to engineering problem with objective solutions.

### Simplicity as Reliability Strategy

Complex designs have more failure modes than simple designs. For AI-generated content:

**Complexity** = More decisions = More opportunities for error
**Simplicity** = Fewer decisions = Fewer opportunities for error

The constraint-based approach enforces simplicity by prohibiting complexity. This isn't limitation—it's reliability engineering.

### Process Over Product

This skill prioritizes reliable process over perfect product. A "good enough" deck generated reliably is better than a "perfect" deck generated inconsistently.

**Reliability metrics**:
- Zero layout failures across hundreds of decks
- Consistent quality regardless of content
- Predictable generation time
- Accessibility compliance as default

**Quality metrics**:
- Subjective aesthetic assessment
- "Wow factor"
- Novelty

For enterprise use, reliability matters more than novelty.

## Continuous Improvement

### Identifying New Failure Modes

As PowerPoint generation capability evolves, new failure modes emerge. Process for incorporating learnings:

1. **Observe failure**: Document specific failure case
2. **Identify pattern**: Is this isolated or systematic?
3. **Determine root cause**: Why did failure occur?
4. **Formulate constraint**: What prohibition prevents recurrence?
5. **Update skill**: Add constraint to design restrictions
6. **Validate**: Test updated skill on previous failure case

### Evolution of Best Practices

Design principles remain stable, but implementation details evolve:

**Stable**:
- Constraint-based approach
- Workflow enforcement
- Pre-execution planning
- Quantified specifications

**Evolving**:
- Specific tools (html2pptx → future alternatives)
- Token/context window management strategies
- Specific prohibited patterns (as new failure modes discovered)

## Conclusion

The constraint-based design approach succeeds because it:

1. **Reduces cognitive load**: Smaller decision space via explicit prohibitions
2. **Prevents failures**: Eliminates known problematic patterns
3. **Enforces reliability**: Tool specification prevents degradation  
4. **Enables validation**: Quantified specifications are measurable
5. **Scales effectively**: Multi-chat architecture manages complexity

**Key insight**: For spatial/visual AI tasks, making constraints MORE explicit (not more complex) produces MORE reliable outputs.

The goal isn't the most beautiful deck possible—it's reliable generation of professional-quality decks at scale. Constraint-based design achieves this goal.
