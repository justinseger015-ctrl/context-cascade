## When to Use This Skill

- **Tool Usage**: When you need to execute specific tools, lookup reference materials, or run automation pipelines
- **Reference Lookup**: When you need to access documented patterns, best practices, or technical specifications
- **Automation Needs**: When you need to run standardized workflows or pipeline processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Manual Processes**: Avoid when manual intervention is more appropriate than automated tools
- **Non-Standard Tools**: Do not use when tools are deprecated, unsupported, or outside standard toolkit

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *Tool Executed Correctly**: Verify tool runs without errors and produces expected output [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Reference Accurate**: Confirm reference material is current and applicable [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Pipeline Complete**: Ensure automation pipeline completes all stages successfully [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases

- **Tool Unavailable**: Handle scenarios where required tool is not installed or accessible
- **Outdated References**: Detect when reference material is obsolete or superseded
- **Pipeline Failures**: Recover gracefully from mid-pipeline failures with clear error messages

## Guardrails
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: use deprecated tools**: Always verify tool versions and support status before execution [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: verify outputs**: Validate tool outputs match expected format and content [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: check health**: Run tool health checks before critical operations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- **Tool Health Checks**: Execute diagnostic commands to verify tool functionality before use
- **Output Validation**: Compare actual outputs against expected schemas or patterns
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution metrics and success rates

Process for applying specific organizational brand guidelines to PowerPoint generation.

## Overview

Brand integration involves extracting style elements from existing branded materials and incorporating them into the master design plan while maintaining the core principles of constraint-based design.

**Key Challenge**: Balance brand requirements with reliable AI generation constraints.

**Solution**: Extract brand elements systematically, then adapt them to constraint-compatible implementations.

## Brand Integration Process

### Phase 1: Brand Element Extraction

**Input**: Existing branded slide(s) or brand guidelines document

**Process**:

1. **Provide reference material**
   ```
   I need to generate slides following our brand guidelines. 
   [Attach branded slide] or [Attach brand guidelines PDF]
   
   Please analyze this and extract:
   - Color palette (exact hex codes)
   - Typography system (font families, sizes, weights)
   - Spacing patterns (margins, element spacing)
   - Visual emphasis techniques
   - Any brand-specific constraints
   ```

2. **AI analyzes and documents**
   - Identifies color hex codes from sample
   - Notes font families and sizing hierarchy
   - Observes spacing patterns
   - Identifies visual emphasis techniques
   - Extracts any explicit brand rules

3. **Critical evaluation**
   - Assess compatibility with design restrictions
   - Identify elements requiring adaptation
   - Flag potential conflicts

**Output**: Documented brand specifications

### Phase 2: Constraint Compatibility Assessment

**Objective**: Determine if brand elements can be implemented within design restrictions.

**Compatible elements** (implement directly):
- Color palettes (any colors work)
- Typography (as long as sizes meet minimums)
- Spacing ratios (if ≥0.5" margins maintained)
- Background treatments (solid colors, subtle gradients)
- Logo placement (if treated as visual element)

**Problematic elements** (require adaptation):
- Border boxes (prohibited) → Replace with color blocks
- Outline shapes (prohibited) → Replace with solid shapes
- Rounded rectangles with text (prohibited) → Replace with rectangles or text on backgrounds
- Text containers (prohibited) → Text directly on backgrounds
- Complex decorative elements (unreliable) → Simplify or remove

**Incompatible elements** (cannot implement):
- Gradients as primary backgrounds (contrast calculation complex)
- Textured backgrounds (interfere with readability)
- Overlapping visual elements (violate constraints)
- Very small brand elements (below size minimums)

### Phase 3: Brand-Adapted Design Plan

**Objective**: Create design plan that honors brand while maintaining constraints.

**Template**:

```
BRAND-ADAPTED DESIGN PLAN

BRAND IDENTITY:
Organization: [Name]
Source: [Branded slide / guidelines doc]

COLOR PALETTE (Brand):
• Primary: [Color name] #[hex] (use for accent bars, emphasis)
• Secondary: [Color name] #[hex] (use for backgrounds)
• Text: [Color name] #[hex] (contrast ratio: X.X:1 on white)
• Background: [Color name] #[hex] (typically white or off-white)

Contrast Verification:
• Primary text on white background: [ratio] (must be ≥4.5:1)
• Primary text on secondary background: [ratio] (must be ≥4.5:1)
• All combinations verified for accessibility

TYPOGRAPHY (Brand):
• Font Family: [Brand font] (fallback: [Web-safe alternative])
• Title size: [X]pt (brand standard, meets ≥24pt minimum)
• Header size: [X]pt (brand standard)
• Body size: [X]pt (brand standard, meets ≥18pt minimum)
• Line spacing: [X] (brand standard)

LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY (Brand-Adapted):
• Margins: [X]" (brand standard, meets ≥0.5" minimum)
• Element spacing: [Description following brand patterns]
• Visual hierarchy: [Brand's approach to emphasis]

BRAND ELEMENTS (Adapted):
Original brand uses [problematic element]:
→ Adapted as: [Constraint-compatible alternative]

Example: Brand uses rounded rectangle containers
→ Adapted as: Rectangular color blocks with same brand colors

VISUAL EMPHASIS (Brand-Compatible):
• Use brand primary color for accent bars (not borders)
• Use brand secondary color for section backgrounds
• Maintain brand spacing ratios
• Follow brand typography hierarchy

EXPLICIT CONSTRAINT COMPLIANCE:
✓ NO BORDER BOXES (brand containers adapted to solid blocks)
✓ NO OUTLINE SHAPES (brand outlines removed, solid shapes used)
✓ NO ROUNDED RECTANGLES WITH TEXT (adapted to rectangles)
✓ Text directly on backgrounds (using brand colors)
✓ All contrast ratios verified (accessibility maintained)
✓ All size minimums met (brand sizes already compliant)
```

### Phase 4: Brand Validation

**After generating slides with brand-adapted plan**:

1. **Visual brand recognition**
   - Does deck "feel" like the brand?
   - Are brand colors recognizable?
   - Is typography appropriate?
   - Does spacing match brand patterns?

2. **Constraint compliance**
   - No design restrictions violated
   - All accessibility requirements met
   - All quantified specifications satisfied

3. **Brand stakeholder review** (if critical)
   - Present to brand owner/manager
   - Confirm acceptability
   - Document any requested adjustments

## Common Brand Adaptation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Border Boxes → Color Blocks

**Brand requirement**: Text in bordered containers

**Problem**: Borders are prohibited (unreliable in AI generation)

**Solution**: Replace with solid color blocks
```
Instead of: [Text in white box with blue border]
Use: [Text on light blue background block]
```

**Rationale**: Achieves visual separation and brand color presence without borders.

### Pattern 2: Rounded Corners → Square Corners

**Brand requirement**: Rounded rectangles for modern aesthetic

**Problem**: Rounded rectangles with text are prohibited

**Solution**: Use square rectangles with same brand colors
```
Instead of: [Text in rounded rectangle container]
Use: [Text on rectangular color block]
```

**Rationale**: Maintains brand color and shape concepts, removes unreliable element.

### Pattern 3: Decorative Borders → Accent Bars

**Brand requirement**: Decorative borders or dividing lines

**Problem**: Decorative elements unreliable, borders prohibited

**Solution**: Replace with solid accent bars in brand colors
```
Instead of: [Decorative line separating sections]
Use: [Solid color bar in brand accent color]
```

**Rationale**: Maintains visual separation and brand color, improves reliability.

### Pattern 4: Textured Backgrounds → Solid Colors

**Brand requirement**: Subtle texture or pattern in background

**Problem**: Textures interfere with contrast calculations and readability

**Solution**: Use solid brand colors or very subtle gradients
```
Instead of: [Text on textured brand background]
Use: [Text on solid brand color background]
```

**Rationale**: Maintains brand color, improves readability and accessibility.

### Pattern 5: Complex Logos → Simplified Placement

**Brand requirement**: Full logo with complex elements

**Problem**: Complex logos may not scale well or may violate single-element rule

**Solution**: Use simplified logo or place strategically
```
Approach 1: Simplified logo mark (icon only) on title slide
Approach 2: Full logo on title slide only
Approach 3: Wordmark in footer (very small, doesn't count as main visual)
```

**Rationale**: Maintains brand presence without compromising content slides.

## Working with Brand Owners

### Initial Consultation

**Explain constraints upfront**:
```
"Our AI generation system works best with clean, simple visual patterns. 
We can incorporate your brand colors, typography, and overall aesthetic, 
but some decorative elements may need to be adapted for reliable generation. 
Let me show you how we can honor your brand within our framework."
```

**Show examples**:
- Present sample slides with brand colors but simplified design
- Demonstrate how adaptation maintains brand recognition
- Explain reliability benefits of simplified approach

**Address concerns**:
- "Will it still look like our brand?" → Yes, colors and typography preserved
- "Why can't we use our exact templates?" → Technical reliability requirements
- "Can we add [decorative element]?" → Depends on complexity, show alternatives

### Iterative Refinement

1. Generate initial deck with brand-adapted design
2. Present to brand owner
3. Gather feedback on brand recognition and acceptability
4. Adjust color emphasis, spacing, or typography if needed
5. Regenerate and review
6. Document approved approach for future use

### Setting Expectations

**Be clear about tradeoffs**:
```
Our approach prioritizes:
1. Reliable generation (no layout failures)
2. Accessibility (readable for all users)
3. Consistency (every slide professional quality)
4. Brand recognition (colors, fonts, overall aesthetic)

We adapt decorative elements for reliability while maintaining brand identity.
```

## Brand Guidelines Document Creation

After successful brand integration, document the approach for consistency:

```
[ORGANIZATION] POWERPOINT BRAND GUIDELINES

APPROVED BY: [Brand Manager Name]
DATE: [Date]
VERSION: 1.0
```

## Troubleshooting Brand Integration

### Issue: Brand owner insists on prohibited elements

**Response**:
1. Demonstrate failure modes with examples
2. Show adapted alternatives side-by-side
3. Emphasize reliability and accessibility benefits
4. Offer pilot project to prove approach
5. Escalate to technical leadership if necessary

### Issue: Brand colors fail contrast requirements

**Response**:
1. Calculate exact contrast ratios
2. Show examples of readability issues
3. Propose adjusted shade (lighter or darker)
4. Explain accessibility legal requirements
5. Document decision and stakeholder approval

### Issue: Brand fonts not available in system

**Response**:
1. Identify web-safe fallback fonts
2. Show visual comparison
3. Coordinate with IT to install brand fonts if critical
4. Document fallback approach
5. Use fallback in generation, swap fonts in final output if needed

### Issue: Multiple brands (merger, conglomerate, etc.)

**Response**:
1. Identify which brand should be primary
2. Extract palette from primary brand
3. Incorporate secondary brand color as accent
4. Use one typography system (typically primary)
5. Document hybrid approach with stakeholder approval

## Advanced: Dynamic Brand Switching

For organizations needing multiple brand presentations:

**Approach**: Create brand profile documents
```
brand-profiles/
  brand-a-design-plan.md
  brand-b-design-plan.md
  brand-c-design-plan.md
```

**In generation prompt**:
```
Use brand profile from brand-a-design-plan.md for this deck.
All slides should follow Brand A color palette and typography system.
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent approach across brands
- Easy switching between brands
- Documented approval for each brand
- Scalable to many brands

## Conclusion

Brand integration succeeds when:
1. Brand elements extracted systematically
2. Problematic elements adapted (not eliminated)
3. Brand owner educated on tradeoffs
4. Approved approach documented
5. Reliability and accessibility maintained

**Key principle**: Honor brand identity through colors, typography, and spacing while adapting decorative elements for reliable AI generation.

The result is presentations that are:
- Recognizably branded
- Reliably generated
- Professionally consistent
- Accessible to all users
