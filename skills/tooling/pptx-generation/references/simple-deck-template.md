## When to Use This Skill

- **Tool Usage**: When you need to execute specific tools, lookup reference materials, or run automation pipelines
- **Reference Lookup**: When you need to access documented patterns, best practices, or technical specifications
- **Automation Needs**: When you need to run standardized workflows or pipeline processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Manual Processes**: Avoid when manual intervention is more appropriate than automated tools
- **Non-Standard Tools**: Do not use when tools are deprecated, unsupported, or outside standard toolkit

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *Tool Executed Correctly**: Verify tool runs without errors and produces expected output [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Reference Accurate**: Confirm reference material is current and applicable [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Pipeline Complete**: Ensure automation pipeline completes all stages successfully [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases

- **Tool Unavailable**: Handle scenarios where required tool is not installed or accessible
- **Outdated References**: Detect when reference material is obsolete or superseded
- **Pipeline Failures**: Recover gracefully from mid-pipeline failures with clear error messages

## Guardrails
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: use deprecated tools**: Always verify tool versions and support status before execution [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: verify outputs**: Validate tool outputs match expected format and content [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: check health**: Run tool health checks before critical operations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- **Tool Health Checks**: Execute diagnostic commands to verify tool functionality before use
- **Output Validation**: Compare actual outputs against expected schemas or patterns
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution metrics and success rates

## Template Structure

```
[WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT]
Use html2pptx workflow only. Debug any installation issues; do not switch to alternative 
approaches. Read entire pptx skill documentation first, then confirm which workflow you'll 
use before proceeding.

[DESIGN RESTRICTIONS]
• NO BORDER BOXES around text elements
• NO OUTLINE SHAPES containing text content
• NO ROUNDED RECTANGLES with text inside
• Use clean typography, spacing, and subtle color blocks instead
• Text should sit directly on slide background or solid color areas

[PRE-EXECUTION DESIGN PLAN]
Before writing any code, describe:
- Clean layout approach without border elements
- Color palette (high contrast, no outlined text boxes)
- Typography hierarchy and spacing strategy
- Visual emphasis through color blocks, not borders

[OBJECTIVE]
Generate PowerPoint slide deck from [describe data/purpose] addressing [specific goals].

[INPUTS]
• [Data source 1]: filename1.csv
• [Data source 2]: filename2.txt
• [Data source 3]: filename3.pdf

[LAYOUT APPROACH]
• Clean white or light colored backgrounds
• Text directly on background (no containers)
• Visual separation through spacing and typography
• Colored accent bars or background sections (not outlined boxes)
• Subtle background color zones instead of bordered elements

[ACCESSIBILITY & CONTRAST REQUIREMENTS]
• All text must have minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
• No dark text on dark backgrounds
• Light backgrounds with dark text preferred
• Test readability at thumbnail size

[LAYOUT CONSTRAINTS]
• Maximum 3 bullets per slide
• 18pt minimum font size (24pt for titles)
• 0.5" minimum margins on all sides
• No overlapping text elements
• Single visual element per slide maximum
• NO BORDERED TEXT BOXES OR OUTLINE SHAPES

[SLIDE-BY-SLIDE REQUIREMENTS]
Slide 1: [Title and purpose]
- [Specific content requirements]
- [Visual emphasis points]

Slide 2: [Section title]
- [Content specifications]
- [Data to include]

[Continue for each slide...]

[VALIDATION GATES]
After generation, please:
• Show thumbnail preview
• Verify contrast ratios (calculate and display)
• Confirm no border boxes or outline shapes present
• Test readability at reduced size
• Validate font sizes meet minimums
• Check margin measurements

[FAILURE CONDITIONS]
If you encounter any of these, STOP and report:
• Generic slides without specific insights
• Missing synthesis of data
• Charts without clear decision implications
• Visual elements that don't support narrative
• Any deviation from design restrictions
```

[VALIDATION GATES]
After generation, please:
• Show thumbnail preview of all slides
• Verify contrast ratios (calculate and display):
  - Navy text on white: should be >12:1
  - Navy text on light blue: should be >7:1
• Confirm zero border boxes or outline shapes present
• Test readability at 25% size
• Validate all font sizes ≥18pt (≥24pt for titles)

[FAILURE CONDITIONS]
If you encounter any of these, STOP and report:
• Unable to extract meaningful insights from financial data
• Data inconsistencies between sources
• Charts too complex for single-visual-element constraint
• Contrast ratios below 4.5:1
• Any border boxes or outline shapes appearing
• Text overlapping or extending beyond margins
```

## Key Principles for Simple Decks

1. **Complete prompt in one block**: All instructions, constraints, and requirements in single comprehensive prompt

2. **Explicit workflow enforcement first**: Lead with html2pptx requirement to prevent tool degradation

3. **Design plan before code**: Require written design description before any slide generation

4. **Negative constraints prominent**: Prohibitions in CAPITAL LETTERS, repeated multiple times

5. **Quantified specifications**: Exact measurements, not vague descriptors

6. **Validation built-in**: Request specific validation checks as part of generation process

7. **Slide-by-slide clarity**: Specify exactly what each slide should contain and emphasize

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T**: "Make a professional deck about our financials"
✅ **DO**: Specify exact slides, data sources, visual constraints, validation requirements

❌ **DON'T**: "Use clean design and good contrast"
✅ **DO**: "4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio, 18pt minimum font size, 0.5" margins"

❌ **DON'T**: "Make it look nice but readable"
✅ **DO**: "NO BORDER BOXES, NO OUTLINE SHAPES, text directly on background, test at thumbnail size"

❌ **DON'T**: Generate slides without design plan
✅ **DO**: Force written design description addressing all restrictions before code generation
