### MCP Integration Guide

Comprehensive guide for integrating MCP tools: `MCP-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`

**Topics Covered**:
- Setup instructions (Claude Flow, Flow-Nexus)
- Core MCP tools documentation
- Integration patterns by skill
- Memory coordination patterns
- Error handling and recovery
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## Architecture Patterns

### Agent Coordination

All skills follow the **MCP Coordinates, Claude Code Executes** pattern:

1. **MCP Tools**: Set up coordination topology (swarm initialization)
2. **Claude Code Task Tool**: Spawn actual agents that perform work
3. **Hooks**: Agents coordinate via shared memory using pre/post task hooks
4. **Aggregation**: Results synthesized from shared memory

### Topology Selection

- **Mesh**: Parallel peer-to-peer (code review, workflow automation)
- **Hierarchical**: Centralized coordination (multi-repo, releases)
- **Star**: Hub-and-spoke (project management)
- **Ring**: Sequential with feedback (not used in current skills)

### Memory Keys Convention

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Token**: Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

2. **Claude Flow MCP** (required):
```bash
claude mcp add claude-flow npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start
```

3. **Flow-Nexus MCP** (optional, for advanced features):
```bash
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start
npx flow-nexus@latest register
npx flow-nexus@latest login
```

### Script Permissions

Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x shared-scripts/*.sh
```

## Skill Metadata

Each skill includes comprehensive YAML frontmatter:

- **name**: Descriptive skill name following convention
- **description**: 3-5 sentence description with use cases
- **agents**: Array of agent names used by skill
- **topology**: Swarm topology (mesh, hierarchical, star, ring)
- **mcp_tools**: Array of MCP tools utilized

## Best Practices

### 1. Parallel Execution

Always spawn agents in parallel using Claude Code's Task tool:

```plaintext
Task("Agent 1", "Instructions...", "agent-type")
Task("Agent 2", "Instructions...", "agent-type")
Task("Agent 3", "Instructions...", "agent-type")
// All execute concurrently in single message
```

### 2. Memory Coordination

Use hooks for agent coordination:

```bash
# Before work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "task description"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "swarm-id"

# During work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --file "output.json" --memory-key "key"

# After work
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "task-id"
```

### 3. Error Handling

Implement graceful error handling:

- Retry GitHub API calls with exponential backoff
- Handle partial failures in multi-repo operations
- Provide rollback mechanisms for deployments
- Validate inputs before expensive operations

### 4. Security

- Never hardcode tokens (use environment variables)
- Pin GitHub Actions to SHA, not tags
- Minimize GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
- Scan for exposed secrets before commits
