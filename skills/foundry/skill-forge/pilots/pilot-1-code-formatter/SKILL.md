## Skill Execution Criteria

### When to Use This Skill
- [AUTO-EXTRACTED from skill description and content]
- [Task patterns this skill is optimized for]
- [Workflow contexts where this skill excels]

### When NOT to Use This Skill
- [Situations where alternative skills are better suited]
- [Anti-patterns that indicate wrong skill choice]
- [Edge cases this skill doesn't handle well]

### Success Criteria
- primary_outcome: "[SKILL-SPECIFIC measurable result based on skill purpose]"
- [assert|neutral] quality_threshold: 0.85 [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- verification_method: "[How to validate skill executed correctly and produced expected outcome]"

### Edge Cases
- case: "Ambiguous or incomplete input"
  handling: "Request clarification, document assumptions, proceed with explicit constraints"
- case: "Conflicting requirements or constraints"
  handling: "Surface conflict to user, propose resolution options, document trade-offs"
- case: "Insufficient context for quality execution"
  handling: "Flag missing information, provide template for needed context, proceed with documented limitations"

### Skill Guardrails
NEVER:
  - "[SKILL-SPECIFIC anti-pattern that breaks methodology]"
  - "[Common mistake that degrades output quality]"
  - "[Shortcut that compromises skill effectiveness]"
ALWAYS:
  - "[SKILL-SPECIFIC requirement for successful execution]"
  - "[Critical step that must not be skipped]"
  - "[Quality check that ensures reliable output]"

### Evidence-Based Execution
self_consistency: "After completing this skill, verify output quality by [SKILL-SPECIFIC validation approach]"
program_of_thought: "Decompose this skill execution into: [SKILL-SPECIFIC sequential steps]"

# Code Formatter

Automatically format code files using language-specific formatters with comprehensive error handling.

## Overview

This skill formats code files by detecting the programming language and applying the appropriate formatter (Prettier for JS/TS, Black for Python, rustfmt for Rust). It provides clear feedback on changes and handles edge cases systematically.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when you need to format code before commits, ensure consistent style across projects, or apply language-specific formatting standards automatically.

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is activated, follow these steps to format code files.

### Step 1: Validate Input File

**Action**: Verify that the specified file exists and is accessible.

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check file exists
if [ ! -f "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$FILE_PATH' not found. Check path and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Verify file is readable
if [ ! -r "$FILE_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Error: Cannot read '$FILE_PATH'. Fix with: chmod +r '$FILE_PATH'"
    exit 2
fi

# Check file size (max 10MB)
file_size=$(stat -c%s "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null || stat -f%z "$FILE_PATH")
if [ $file_size -gt 10485760 ]; then
    echo "Warning: File is $(($file_size / 1024 / 1024))MB (max: 10MB). Continue? (y/n)"
    read -r response
    if [[ "$response" != "y" ]]; then
        exit 0
    fi
fi
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✓ File exists at specified path
- ✓ File is readable (not a permissions error)
- ✓ File size ≤ 10MB or user confirms proceed

**Error Handling**:
- If file not found (exit 1) → Display error with path, abort
- If permissions denied (exit 2) → Display error with chmod fix, abort
- If file too large → Warn user, allow proceed or abort

### Step 2: Detect File Language and Formatter

**Action**: Determine programming language from file extension and select appropriate formatter.

**Implementation**:
```bash
