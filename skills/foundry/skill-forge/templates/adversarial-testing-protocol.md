**Research Foundation**: Perez et al. (2022) - Red teaming reduces vulnerabilities by 58%, post-deployment issues by 67%

**Purpose**: Systematic vulnerability discovery through adversarial attacks before skills reach production, catching edge cases, failure modes, and hidden assumptions.

---

## When to Apply Adversarial Testing

Use adversarial testing whenever:
- Completing skill validation (Phase 7)
- High-stakes skills with potential for misuse
- Complex workflows with many decision points
- Skills handling edge cases or untrusted input
- After major skill revisions

---

## The 4-Step Adversarial Protocol

### Step 1: Brainstorm Failure Modes (5 min)

**Action**: Generate 10+ ways the skill could fail, produce wrong results, or be misused.

**Brainstorming Techniques**:
- **Intentional Misinterpretation**: Follow instructions literally but maliciously
- **Missing Prerequisites**: What if expected files/tools don't exist?
- **Boundary Testing**: Empty input, huge input, malformed input
- **Timing Attacks**: What if operations execute out of order?
- **Permission Failures**: What if file/network access denied?
- **Resource Exhaustion**: What if system resources (memory/disk) limited?
- **Integration Failures**: What if dependencies unavailable?
- **User Error**: What if user provides wrong information?
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual but valid scenarios
- **Adversarial Input**: Deliberately crafted to break skill

**Example** (code-formatter skill):
```
Failure Mode Brainstorm:
1. File doesn't exist at specified path
2. File is binary, not text (e.g., .exe, .jpg)
3. File is too large (>100MB) - causes timeout
4. File has no file extension (can't detect language)
5. Multiple formatters installed (which one to use?)
6. Formatter binary not in PATH
7. File has syntax errors (formatter crashes)
8. File is read-only (can't write formatted output)
9. User cancels mid-format (leaves file corrupted)
10. Format conflicts with .editorconfig rules
11. Network drive timeout during file read
12. Concurrent edits by another process
13. Symbolic link points to sensitive file
14. File encoding is non-UTF-8 (corrupts content)
15. Formatter version incompatible with syntax
```

---

### Step 2: Risk Scoring Matrix (5 min)

**Action**: Score each failure mode using: **Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

**Likelihood Scale (1-5)**:
- **1 - Rare**: Theoretical edge case, unlikely to occur
- **2 - Unlikely**: Possible but uncommon scenario
- **3 - Possible**: Might happen occasionally
- **4 - Likely**: Happens regularly in normal use
- **5 - Very Likely**: Happens frequently or by default

**Impact Scale (1-5)**:
- **1 - Trivial**: Minor inconvenience, easy to recover
- **2 - Low**: Small disruption, user can work around
- **3 - Medium**: Moderate disruption, requires intervention
- **4 - High**: Major disruption, data loss possible
- **5 - Critical**: Catastrophic failure, data corruption, security breach

**Risk Priority**:
- **Score ≥12**: CRITICAL - Must fix before deployment
- **Score 8-11**: HIGH - Should fix if feasible
- **Score 4-7**: MEDIUM - Fix if time permits
- **Score 1-3**: LOW - Document as known limitation

**Example Risk Matrix** (code-formatter skill):
```
| ID | Failure Mode                          | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority  |
|----|---------------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 1  | File doesn't exist                    | 4          | 2      | 8          | HIGH      |
| 2  | File is binary                        | 3          | 3      | 9          | HIGH      |
| 3  | File too large (>100MB)               | 2          | 4      | 8          | HIGH      |
| 4  | No file extension                     | 3          | 3      | 9          | HIGH      |
| 5  | Multiple formatters                   | 2          | 3      | 6          | MEDIUM    |
| 6  | Formatter not in PATH                 | 4          | 4      | 16         | CRITICAL  |
| 7  | File has syntax errors                | 4          | 3      | 12         | CRITICAL  |
| 8  | File is read-only                     | 3          | 3      | 9          | HIGH      |
| 9  | User cancels mid-format               | 2          | 5      | 10         | HIGH      |
| 10 | Conflicts with .editorconfig          | 3          | 2      | 6          | MEDIUM    |
| 11 | Network drive timeout                 | 2          | 3      | 6          | MEDIUM    |
| 12 | Concurrent edits                      | 2          | 4      | 8          | HIGH      |
| 13 | Symlink to sensitive file             | 1          | 5      | 5          | MEDIUM    |
| 14 | Non-UTF-8 encoding                    | 3          | 4      | 12         | CRITICAL  |
| 15 | Formatter version incompatible        | 3          | 3      | 9          | HIGH      |
```

**Summary**:
- CRITICAL (score ≥12): 3 issues
- HIGH (score 8-11): 6 issues
- MEDIUM (score 4-7): 6 issues
- LOW (score 1-3): 0 issues

---

### Step 3: Fix Top Vulnerabilities (10-20 min)

**Action**: Address all CRITICAL and HIGH priority issues (score ≥8). Update skill instructions, add validation checks, improve error handling.

**Fix Strategies**:

#### **Validation & Prerequisites**
- Add input validation at skill entry
- Check file existence before operations
- Verify tool availability (which/where commands)
- Validate file types and extensions
- Check permissions before write operations

#### **Error Handling**
- Wrap risky operations in try-catch equivalents
- Provide clear error messages with recovery steps
- Graceful degradation when dependencies missing
- Timeout mechanisms for long-running operations
- Rollback mechanisms for partially completed work

#### **Edge Case Handling**
- Handle empty/null inputs explicitly
- Set reasonable limits (file size, timeout, iterations)
- Support multiple valid scenarios (multiple formatters → ask user)
- Document known limitations clearly

#### **User Guidance**
- Provide clear success/failure feedback
- Offer actionable next steps on error
- Include troubleshooting guide in skill
- Add "What to do if..." section

**Example Fixes** (code-formatter skill):
```markdown
## Fixes Applied:

### CRITICAL Issue #6: Formatter not in PATH (Score: 16)
**Original**: Assume formatter exists, run `prettier file.js`
**Fixed**:
1. Before formatting, run: `which prettier || where prettier`
2. If not found, provide installation instructions
3. Ask user: "Prettier not found. Install now? (Yes/No)"
4. If Yes: `npm install -g prettier`, then retry
5. If No: Abort with clear message

### CRITICAL Issue #7: File has syntax errors (Score: 12)
**Original**: Run formatter, crash on syntax error
**Fixed**:
1. Add `--check` flag first: `prettier --check file.js`
2. If syntax errors found, display error location
3. Ask user: "Fix syntax errors first or format anyway? (Fix/Force)"
4. If Fix: Abort with error location highlighted
5. If Force: Use `--write` with `--no-semi` fallback

### CRITICAL Issue #14: Non-UTF-8 encoding (Score: 12)
**Original**: Assume UTF-8, corrupt file on write
**Fixed**:
1. Detect file encoding: `file -i file.js`
2. If non-UTF-8, warn user: "File is [encoding]. Convert to UTF-8? (Yes/No)"
3. If Yes: Convert with `iconv` before formatting
4. If No: Abort with explanation
5. Always backup original file before write
```

---

### Step 4: Reattack Until Clean (5-10 min)

**Action**: Repeat Steps 1-3 on the FIXED version. Continue until no CRITICAL or HIGH issues remain.

**Reattack Process**:
1. **Treat the skill as adversary**: Assume it's hiding vulnerabilities
2. **Focus on fixes**: Do the fixes introduce new issues?
3. **Test edge cases of fixes**: What if installation fails? What if iconv missing?
4. **Combine failure modes**: What if multiple issues occur simultaneously?
5. **Stress test boundaries**: Push limits harder (10GB file? 1000 concurrent edits?)

**Example Reattack** (code-formatter skill):
```
Round 2 Brainstorm (attacking the fixes):
1. NEW: `which prettier` succeeds but prettier is a broken symlink
2. NEW: User says "Install now" but npm not installed
3. NEW: Network down during `npm install -g prettier`
4. NEW: `iconv` not available on system for encoding conversion
5. NEW: Backup file creation fails (disk full)
6. NEW: User interrupts during encoding conversion (corrupts original)
7. EXISTING: File changes between --check and --write (race condition)

Round 2 Risk Scoring:
| ID | Failure Mode                     | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority  |
|----|----------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| 1  | Broken symlink                   | 2          | 3      | 6          | MEDIUM    |
| 2  | npm not installed                | 3          | 3      | 9          | HIGH      |
| 3  | Network down during install      | 2          | 3      | 6          | MEDIUM    |
| 4  | iconv unavailable                | 3          | 4      | 12         | CRITICAL  |
| 5  | Backup fails (disk full)         | 2          | 5      | 10         | HIGH      |
| 6  | Interrupt during conversion      | 2          | 5      | 10         | HIGH      |
| 7  | Race condition (check → write)   | 2          | 4      | 8          | HIGH      |

Round 2 Fixes:
- #2 (HIGH): Check `which npm` before `npm install`, offer manual install URL
- #4 (CRITICAL): Check `which iconv`, fall back to Python `codecs` or abort
- #5 (HIGH): Check disk space before backup (`df -h`), warn if <100MB free
- #6 (HIGH): Use atomic operations (write to temp file, then rename)
- #7 (HIGH): Add file hash check between --check and --write, retry if changed
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- ✓ Zero CRITICAL issues remain
- ✓ HIGH issues reduced to MEDIUM (or documented as known limitations)
- ✓ All fixes tested with adversarial inputs
- ✓ Skill includes comprehensive error handling section
- ✓ Troubleshooting guide added to skill

## Integration with Other Techniques

Adversarial Testing works synergistically with:
- **Chain-of-Verification (CoV)**: CoV catches errors in design, adversarial testing catches errors in execution
- **Quality Gates**: Adversarial testing provides pass/fail criteria for Phase 7
- **Metrics Tracking**: Risk scores become quantitative metrics
- **Multi-Persona Debate**: Different personas identify different failure modes

---

## Quick Reference Checklist

For Phase 7 validation:
- ✓ Step 1: Brainstorm 10+ failure modes (5 min)
- ✓ Step 2: Score all modes by risk matrix (5 min)
- ✓ Step 3: Fix all CRITICAL (≥12) and top HIGH (8-11) issues (10-20 min)
- ✓ Step 4: Reattack until no CRITICAL issues remain (5-10 min)
- ✓ Quality Gate: Zero CRITICAL, documented HIGH/MEDIUM
- ✓ Add error handling section to skill
- ✓ Add troubleshooting guide

**Time Investment**: 25-40 minutes per skill
**ROI**: 58% more vulnerabilities caught, 67% fewer production issues
**When to Use**: ALWAYS in Phase 7, ESPECIALLY for high-stakes skills

---

**Remember**: Adversarial testing is not about being paranoid - it's about catching real-world failures BEFORE users encounter them. The best skills are battle-tested against worst-case scenarios.
