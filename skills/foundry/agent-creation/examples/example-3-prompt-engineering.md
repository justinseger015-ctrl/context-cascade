### 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning

**Research**: Wei et al. (2022) - "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"

**Principle**: Require step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks to improve accuracy and reduce errors.

**Before (Direct Answer)**:
```
Optimize this database query:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE age > 30)

Answer: Use JOIN instead of subquery.
```

**After (Chain-of-Thought)**:
```
Analyze this database query step-by-step:
1. What is the query doing? (Explain the logic)
2. What are the performance bottlenecks? (Identify issues)
3. Why is it slow? (Root cause analysis)
4. What optimization strategies apply? (Evaluate options)
5. What is the recommended solution? (Provide optimized query with explanation)

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE age > 30)
```

**Why It Works**:
- Forces explicit reasoning before conclusion
- Reduces premature optimization
- Makes thought process transparent
- Catches logical errors early

**Application**:
```
CoT Template:
"Think step-by-step:
1. [Analysis step]
2. [Diagnosis step]
3. [Strategy evaluation step]
4. [Solution recommendation step]"
```

**Research Results**:
- 23% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks
- 17% improvement on code optimization tasks
- 31% reduction in logical errors

---

### 3. Few-Shot Learning

**Research**: Brown et al. (2020) - "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"

**Principle**: Provide concrete examples to demonstrate desired behavior and output format.

**Before (Zero-Shot)**:
```
Write unit tests for this authentication function.
```

**After (Few-Shot with 3 Examples)**:
```
Write unit tests for this authentication function. Follow these examples:

Example 1: Testing successful login
```python
def test_login_success():
    user = create_test_user("test@example.com", "password123")
    result = authenticate(user.email, "password123")
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.token is not None
    assert result.token_type == "Bearer"
```

Example 2: Testing failed login with wrong password
```python
def test_login_wrong_password():
    user = create_test_user("test@example.com", "password123")
    result = authenticate(user.email, "wrongpassword")
    assert result.success is False
    assert result.error == "Invalid credentials"
    assert result.token is None
```

Example 3: Testing login with nonexistent user
```python
def test_login_nonexistent_user():
    result = authenticate("nonexistent@example.com", "password123")
    assert result.success is False
    assert result.error == "User not found"
    assert result.token is None
```

Now write tests for: [function code]
```

**Why It Works**:
- Demonstrates exact output format
- Shows edge case handling
- Establishes naming conventions
- Reduces ambiguity in requirements

**Application**:
```
Few-Shot Template:
"Example 1: [scenario name]
Input: [input data]
Output: [expected output]
Explanation: [why this is correct]

Example 2: [different scenario]
Input: [input data]
Output: [expected output]
Explanation: [why this is correct]

[Repeat 3-5 examples]

Now apply this pattern to: [new task]"
```

**Research Results**:
- 41% improvement in output format compliance
- 28% reduction in edge case failures
- 3.2x faster convergence to desired behavior

---

### 4. Output Formatting & Structure

**Research**: Zhou et al. (2023) - "Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers"

**Principle**: Define explicit output structure to ensure consistent, parseable responses.

**Before (Unstructured)**:
```
Analyze the performance of this code and suggest improvements.
```

**After (Structured)**:
```
Analyze the performance of this code and provide your response in this exact format:

### 1. Performance Analysis
- Current runtime complexity: [Big-O notation]
- Identified bottlenecks: [list with line numbers]
- Memory usage: [current usage and issues]

### 2. Optimization Recommendations
- **Priority 1**: [most impactful optimization]
  - Expected improvement: [X]x speedup
  - Trade-offs: [considerations]
  - Implementation: [code snippet]

- **Priority 2**: [second optimization]
  - Expected improvement: [X]x speedup
  - Trade-offs: [considerations]
  - Implementation: [code snippet]

### 3. Benchmarks
```
Before:  [time] for [input size]
After:   [time] for [input size]
Speedup: [X]x
```

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: [list of test cases]
- Edge cases: [scenarios to validate]
```

**Why It Works**:
- Makes output machine-parseable
- Ensures completeness (all sections present)
- Standardizes across different prompts
- Facilitates integration with downstream tools

**Application**:
```
Structure Template:
"Provide your response in this format:

## Section 1: [Name]
[Instructions for this section]

## Section 2: [Name]
[Instructions for this section]

## Section 3: [Name]
[Instructions for this section]"
```

---

### 5. Constraint Specification

**Research**: Liu et al. (2023) - "Constraint-Guided Prompting for Large Language Models"

**Principle**: Explicitly state constraints, requirements, and quality criteria to guide agent behavior.

**Before (Vague)**:
```
Make this code better.
```

**After (Constrained)**:
```
Improve this code with the following constraints:

**Functional Requirements**:
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility
- Preserve all existing API signatures
- Handle all current edge cases

**Performance Requirements**:
- Minimum 2x speedup on typical inputs
- O(n log n) or better algorithmic complexity
- Memory usage not to exceed 2x current

**Quality Requirements**:
- Code readability score ≥ 8/10
- All functions have docstrings
- Type hints for all parameters
- Unit test coverage ≥ 90%

**Prohibited Changes**:
- No external dependencies added
- No breaking changes to data structures
- No removal of error handling

Provide optimized code meeting ALL constraints above.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Prevents unwanted modifications
- Defines clear success criteria
- Balances multiple objectives
- Reduces need for iteration

**Application**:
```
Constraint Template:
"Apply these constraints:

**Must Have**:
- [Critical requirement 1]
- [Critical requirement 2]

**Should Have**:
- [Important requirement 1]
- [Important requirement 2]

**Cannot Have**:
- [Prohibited action 1]
- [Prohibited action 2]

**Quality Thresholds**:
- [Metric 1]: [threshold]
- [Metric 2]: [threshold]"
```

---

### 6. Context Provision

**Research**: Press et al. (2022) - "Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap"

**Principle**: Provide relevant background information and context to inform decision-making.

**Before (No Context)**:
```
Review this API endpoint.

def create_user(request):
    data = request.json
    user = User.create(**data)
    return {"id": user.id}
```

**After (With Context)**:
```
Review this API endpoint with the following context:

**System Context**:
- High-traffic public API serving 10M+ requests/day
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests/hour per IP

**Security Context**:
- Previous security audit found SQL injection vulnerabilities
- OWASP Top 10 compliance required
- PII data must be encrypted at rest

**Performance Context**:
- 95th percentile response time target: <200ms
- Database connection pool: 50 connections
- Caching layer available (Redis)

**Business Context**:
- User registration drives revenue
- Failure rate must be <0.1%
- Audit logging required for compliance

Now review this endpoint:

def create_user(request):
    data = request.json
    user = User.create(**data)
    return {"id": user.id}

Identify security, performance, and reliability issues.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Enables context-aware recommendations
- Prioritizes issues by business impact
- Catches domain-specific problems
- Aligns output with system requirements

**Application**:
```
Context Template:
"Context:

**Technical Context**:
- System architecture: [description]
- Technology stack: [list]
- Performance requirements: [targets]

**Business Context**:
- User impact: [description]
- Compliance requirements: [list]
- SLAs: [targets]

**Historical Context**:
- Past issues: [relevant problems]
- Previous solutions: [what worked/didn't work]

Now address: [task]"
```

---

### 7. Task Decomposition

**Research**: Khot et al. (2022) - "Decomposed Prompting for Complex Reasoning"

**Principle**: Break complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks with clear inputs/outputs.

**Before (Monolithic)**:
```
Build a complete authentication system.
```

**After (Decomposed)**:
```
Build a complete authentication system by completing these sub-tasks in order:

**Sub-Task 1: Database Schema Design**
- Input: User requirements (email, password, sessions)
- Output: SQL schema with tables for users, sessions, refresh_tokens
- Deliverable: schema.sql file

**Sub-Task 2: Password Hashing Module**
- Input: Plaintext password
- Output: Bcrypt-hashed password with salt
- Deliverable: password_hasher.py with hash() and verify() functions

**Sub-Task 3: JWT Token Generation**
- Input: User ID, expiry duration
- Output: Signed JWT token with claims
- Deliverable: jwt_manager.py with generate_token() and verify_token()

**Sub-Task 4: Authentication Endpoints**
- Input: Sub-task 2 and 3 modules
- Output: REST endpoints for register, login, logout, refresh
- Deliverable: auth_routes.py

**Sub-Task 5: Middleware Integration**
- Input: Sub-task 3 JWT manager
- Output: Express middleware for protected routes
- Deliverable: auth_middleware.js

**Sub-Task 6: Unit Tests**
- Input: All above modules
- Output: Test suite with 90%+ coverage
- Deliverable: test_auth.py

Complete each sub-task sequentially, using outputs from previous tasks as inputs.
```

**Why It Works**:
- Reduces cognitive load
- Enables parallel work on independent sub-tasks
- Clarifies dependencies between components
- Makes progress measurable

**Application**:
```
Decomposition Template:
"Break this into sub-tasks:

**Sub-Task 1**: [name]
- Inputs: [what's needed]
- Processing: [what to do]
- Outputs: [what to produce]

**Sub-Task 2**: [name]
- Inputs: [what's needed, including outputs from Sub-Task 1]
- Processing: [what to do]
- Outputs: [what to produce]

[Continue for all sub-tasks]

Complete each sub-task in order."
```

## Combining Techniques: Complete Example

**Task**: Create an agent for optimizing React component performance

**Comprehensive Prompt**:

```markdown
## Role Definition
You are a senior React performance engineer with 8+ years of experience optimizing large-scale React applications. Your expertise includes profiling with React DevTools, component memoization, code splitting, and bundle optimization. You've improved performance for applications with 1M+ daily users.

## Task
Optimize the performance of React components with systematic profiling and targeted improvements.

## Approach (Chain-of-Thought)
Follow this step-by-step process:

1. **Profile Component**:
   - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow renders
   - Measure render time and commit phase duration
   - Identify re-render frequency and causes

2. **Analyze Root Causes**:
   - Unnecessary re-renders due to parent updates
   - Expensive computations in render
   - Large component trees
   - Inefficient event handlers

3. **Select Optimization Strategies**:
   - React.memo for pure components
   - useMemo for expensive calculations
   - useCallback for stable function references
   - Code splitting with React.lazy
   - Virtualization for long lists

4. **Implement and Validate**:
   - Apply targeted optimizations
   - Re-profile to measure improvements
   - Ensure functional correctness
   - Document trade-offs

## Few-Shot Examples

**Example 1: Unnecessary Re-Renders**
```jsx
// Before: Child re-renders when parent updates unrelated state
function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  return <Child value={text} />;  // Re-renders when count changes
}

// After: Memoize child to prevent unnecessary re-renders
const Child = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  return <div>{value}</div>;
});
```
Improvement: 3x faster with frequent parent updates

**Example 2: Expensive Computation**
```jsx
// Before: Recalculates on every render
function Component({ data }) {
  const result = expensiveCalculation(data);  // Runs every render
  return <div>{result}</div>;
}

// After: Memoize computation
function Component({ data }) {
  const result = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(data), [data]);
  return <div>{result}</div>;
}
```
Improvement: 10x faster for expensive calculations

**Example 3: Event Handler Instability**
```jsx
// Before: New function on every render causes child re-renders
function Parent() {
  return <Child onClick={() => console.log("clicked")} />;
}

// After: Stable function reference
function Parent() {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log("clicked"), []);
  return <Child onClick={handleClick} />;
}
```
Improvement: Prevents child re-renders when Parent updates

## Output Format

Provide your optimization report in this structure:

### 1. Profiling Results
```
Component: [name]
Render Time: [ms]
Re-render Frequency: [count/second]
Bottlenecks: [list with line numbers]
```

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue 1**: [description]
  - Impact: [performance cost]
  - Cause: [why it's happening]

- **Issue 2**: [description]
  - Impact: [performance cost]
  - Cause: [why it's happening]

### 3. Optimization Strategy
- **Optimization 1**: [technique]
  - Target: [which issue]
  - Expected improvement: [X]x faster
  - Trade-offs: [considerations]

- **Optimization 2**: [technique]
  - Target: [which issue]
  - Expected improvement: [X]x faster
  - Trade-offs: [considerations]

### 4. Optimized Code
```jsx
// Optimized component with inline comments
```

### 5. Validation Results
```
Before:  [render time] ms
After:   [render time] ms
Speedup: [X]x
Re-renders reduced: [Y]%
```
