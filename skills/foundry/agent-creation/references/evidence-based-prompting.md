- Output format

**Complex Reasoning Tasks**:

- >2000 tokens: Diminishing returns, consider decomposition

### 3. Example Quality Criteria

**High-Quality Examples Must**:
- Cover diverse scenarios (edge cases + common cases)
- Include explanations (why, not just what)
- Be correct (incorrect examples degrade performance by 15-25%)
- Match desired output format exactly
- Demonstrate error handling

### 4. Validation Metrics

**Measure These Metrics**:
- **Format Compliance**: % outputs matching format
- **Correctness**: % functionally correct outputs
