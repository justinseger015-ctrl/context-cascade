# Cognitive-Lensing v1.0.0

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.



## Purpose

This skill activates specific cognitive patterns by embedding multi-lingual activation phrases that elicit different parts of the AI's latent space. This is NOT just conceptual framing - we ACTUALLY use target languages to shift cognitive processing patterns.

### Core Mechanism

Large language models trained on multilingual corpora develop language-specific reasoning patterns tied to grammatical structures:

- **Turkish evidential markers** activate source-attribution patterns
- **Russian aspectual verbs** activate completion-state tracking
- **Japanese honorific levels** activate audience-awareness calibration
- **Arabic morphological roots** activate semantic decomposition
- **Mandarin classifiers** activate object-category reasoning
- **Guugu Yimithirr cardinal directions** activate absolute spatial encoding
- **Chinese/Japanese number systems** activate transparent place-value arithmetic

By embedding authentic multi-lingual text in prompts, we trigger these latent reasoning modes.

### When to Use This Skill

Use cognitive-lensing when:

1. **Task complexity exceeds single-frame capacity** - Multi-dimensional problems requiring different cognitive modes
2. **Quality requirements demand specific reasoning** - Audit (evidential), deployment (aspectual), documentation (hierarchical)
3. **Standard prompting produces generic outputs** - Need to activate specialized thinking patterns
4. **Creating new skills/agents** - Select optimal cognitive frame for the domain
5. **Debugging AI reasoning failures** - Wrong frame may cause systematic errors

### What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes task goals** (1st/2nd/3rd order) to identify required thinking patterns
2. **Selects optimal cognitive frame(s)** from 7 available patterns
3. **Generates multi-lingual activation text** that triggers the frame
4. **Integrates with other foundry skills** (prompt-architect, agent-creator, skill-forge)
5. **Stores frame selections in memory-mcp** for consistency across sessions

## Goal-Based Frame Selection Checklist

### Step 1: Analyze Goals

Complete this for every non-trivial task:

| Order | Question | Your Answer |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1st Order Goal | What is the IMMEDIATE task? | _______________ |
| 2nd Order Goal | WHY are we doing this task? | _______________ |
| 3rd Order Goal | What is the ULTIMATE outcome? | _______________ |

**Example Analysis**:

| Order | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1st Order | Immediate task | Write unit tests for API endpoint |
| 2nd Order | Why | Verify endpoint behavior is correct |
| 3rd Order | Ultimate outcome | Ensure production reliability |

### Step 2: Identify Dominant Thought Process

| Question | If YES, Use Frame |
|----------|-------------------|
| Is tracking "done vs not done" critical? | Aspectual (Russian) |
| Is source reliability critical? | Evidential (Turkish) |
| Is audience/formality critical? | Hierarchical (Japanese) |
| Is semantic decomposition needed? | Morphological (Arabic/Hebrew) |
| Is physical/visual comparison needed? | Classifier (Mandarin) |
| Is spatial navigation needed? | Spatial-Absolute (Guugu Yimithirr) |
| Is mathematical precision needed? | Numerical-Transparent (Chinese/Japanese) |

**Example Selection**:

For "Write unit tests for API endpoint":
- Tracking done/not done: YES (need to track test coverage completion)
- Source reliability: YES (need to verify test assertions match specs)

Selected Frames:
- Primary: Aspectual (Russian) - for completion tracking
- Secondary: Evidential (Turkish) - for assertion verification

### Step 3: Select Primary Frame

Based on analysis, select:
- **Primary Frame**: _______________
- **Secondary Frame (optional)**: _______________
- **Rationale**: _______________
