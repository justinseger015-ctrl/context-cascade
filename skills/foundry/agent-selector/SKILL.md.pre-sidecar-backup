# Agent Selector Micro-Skill

## Phase 0: Expertise Loading

Before selecting agents:

1. **Detect Domain**: Identify task domain from request
2. **Check Expertise**: Look for `.claude/expertise/agent-selection.yaml`
3. **Load Context**: If exists, load agent performance history and preferences
4. **Apply Configuration**: Use expertise for optimal agent matching

## Purpose

Intelligently selects the most appropriate specialized agent from the 203-agent registry based on:
- Task requirements and complexity
- Agent capabilities and specializations
- Domain expertise (category/subcategory)
- Tool and MCP requirements
- Phase alignment (planning, development, testing, etc.)

**Critical for Phase 4 routing** to ensure Claude Code uses specialized agents instead of generic ones.

## When to Use

- **Before any Task() invocation** in Phase 5 execution
- When planning multi-agent workflows and need optimal agent assignment
- When you're unsure which specialized agent to use for a task
- To validate that a generic agent name has a specialized alternative

## How It Works

**4-Step Process:**

1. **Parse Task Requirements**
   - Extract domain (backend, frontend, database, testing, etc.)
   - Identify key capabilities needed (Express.js, PostgreSQL, TDD, etc.)
   - Determine phase (planning, development, testing, deployment)
   - Note tool/MCP requirements

2. **Semantic Search (Memory MCP)**
   - Query Memory MCP with task description
   - Get top 5-10 candidate agents ranked by similarity
   - Filter by category/phase if known

3. **Capability Matching**
   - Score each candidate agent based on:
     - Exact capability matches (highest priority)
     - Domain specialization (category/subcategory)
     - Tool/MCP alignment
     - Phase alignment
   - Apply fallback rules if no perfect match

4. **Return Selection + Reasoning**
   - Selected agent name
   - Agent source (file path in registry)
   - Capabilities that matched
   - Alternatives considered
   - Selection reasoning

## Usage

```javascript
// Skill invocation
Skill("agent-selector")

// Agent will prompt you for:
// 1. Task description (what needs to be done)
// 2. Domain hint (optional: backend, frontend, testing, etc.)
// 3. Phase hint (optional: development, testing, deployment)

// Output:
{
  "selected_agent": "dev-backend-api",
  "agent_source": "delivery/development/backend/dev-backend-api.md",
  "agent_category": "delivery/development/backend",
  "capabilities": ["Express.js", "REST APIs", "JWT", "OpenAPI"],
  "selection_reasoning": "Specialized backend API agent with exact match for Express.js + REST requirements",
  "alternatives_considered": [
    {
      "name": "backend-specialist",
      "score": 0.82,
      "reason": "Less API-specific, more general backend work"
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## Integration with Phase 4 Routing

**Automatic Integration:**

When Phase 4 routing runs, it MUST use this skill (or inline equivalent) to select agents:

```javascript
// Phase 4 Routing
for (const task of plan.tasks) {
  // Invoke agent-selector
  const agentSelection = Skill("agent-selector", {
    task: task.description,
    domain: task.domain,
    phase: task.phase
  });

  // Use selected agent in Phase 5
  task.agent = agentSelection.selected_agent;
  task.agent_source = agentSelection.agent_source;
  task.agent_capabilities = agentSelection.capabilities;
  task.agent_reasoning = agentSelection.selection_reasoning;
}
```

## Agent Selection Criteria (Priority Order)

1. **Exact Capability Match** (score: 1.0)
   - Agent metadata lists exact task requirement
   - Example: "Express.js API development" → dev-backend-api

2. **Domain Specialization** (score: 0.9)
   - Agent is in correct category/subcategory
   - Example: Backend task → delivery/development/backend agents

3. **Tool Requirements** (score: 0.8)
   - Agent has required tools/MCP servers
   - Example: Needs Post
