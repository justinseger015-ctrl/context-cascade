## Introduction

### What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the systematic design and optimization of instructions for AI language models to achieve specific, high-quality outcomes. It combines:

- **Art**: Creative problem-solving and intuition about how to frame tasks
- **Science**: Research-backed techniques and empirical testing
- **Engineering**: Systematic processes and quality assurance

### Why It Matters

The difference between a mediocre and exceptional prompt can be:
- 2-3x improvement in reasoning accuracy
- 80%+ reduction in errors
- Consistent vs. unpredictable outputs
- Production-ready vs. prototype quality

### Who This Guide Is For

- Developers building AI-powered applications
- Researchers conducting systematic experiments
- Product teams designing AI features
- Anyone who wants reliable, high-quality AI outputs

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

**Bad**: "Leverage synergistic paradigms to optimize the solution vector"
**Good**: "Improve the algorithm to run 2x faster while using less memory"

Make your intent crystal clear. Avoid jargon, ambiguity, and vague language.

### 2. Specificity Beats Generality

**Bad**: "Analyze this data"
**Good**: "Analyze this sales data to identify the top 3 growth opportunities, focusing on year-over-year trends and seasonal patterns"

Be explicit about what you want, how you want it, and why.

### 3. Structure Reduces Confusion

**Bad**: Long wall of text with no organization
**Good**: Hierarchical structure with headers, lists, and clear sections

Organize complex prompts so both humans and AI can parse them easily.

### 4. Context Prevents Errors

**Bad**: "Use the standard format"
**Good**: "Use JSON format with fields: name (string), age (integer), skills (array of strings)"

Don't assume shared understanding. Make context explicit.

### 5. Examples Beat Descriptions

**Bad**: "Format the output nicely"
**Good**: Show 2-3 concrete examples of desired output format

Demonstration is more powerful than explanation.

## The Prompt Engineering Framework

### Phase 1: Define Objectives

**Questions to Answer**:
- What specific output do I need?
- What would success look like?
- What constraints must be satisfied?
- What edge cases should be handled?

**Template**:
```
Objective: [Clear, specific goal]
Success Criteria: [Measurable outcomes]
Constraints: [Hard requirements]
Edge Cases: [Boundary conditions]
```

### Phase 2: Gather Context

---

## Evidence-Based Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

**When**: Complex reasoning, multi-step problems
**How**: Request explicit step-by-step thinking
**Impact**: 2-3x improvement on reasoning tasks (Wei et al., 2022)

**Example**:
```
Solve this problem step by step:
1. First, identify what we know
2. Then, plan our approach
3. Execute the plan with intermediate steps
4. Finally, verify our answer
```

### Self-Consistency

**When**: Factual accuracy, analytical rigor
**How**: Request validation from multiple perspectives
**Impact**: Reduces errors by 15-30% (Wang et al., 2022)

**Example**:
```
After reaching your conclusion:
1. Validate against known facts
2. Consider alternative interpretations
3. Identify areas of uncertainty
4. Flag assumptions made
```

### Program-of-Thought

**When**: Mathematical, logical, computational tasks
**How**: Structure as explicit computational steps
**Impact**: 90%+ accuracy on math problems (Chen et al., 2022)

**Example**:
```
Solve step by step, showing all calculations:
- State what you're calculating
- Show the computation
- Display the result
- Verify correctness
```

### Few-Shot Learning

**When**: Pattern-based tasks, format specification
**How**: Provide 2-5 concrete examples
**Impact**: Significant improvement on structured tasks (Brown et al., 2020)

**Example**:
```
Here are examples of the desired format:

Example 1:
Input: [input 1]
Output: [output 1]

Example 2:
Input: [input 2]
Output: [output 2]

Now process: [actual input]
```

### Plan-and-Solve

**When**: Complex multi-stage workflows
**How**: Separate planning from execution
**Impact**: Better organization and completeness (Wang et al., 2023)

**Example**:
```
Approach this in three phases:

**Phase 1: Planning**
Create a detailed plan with steps, dependencies, and success criteria

**Phase 2: Execution**
Implement the plan systematically, documenting progress

**Phase 3: Verification**
Validate results against original requirements
```

## Structural Optimization

### Context Positioning

**Principle**: Critical information gets more attention at beginning and end

**Pattern**:
```
[BEGINNING - Critical Information]
- Core task objective
- Most important constraints

[MIDDLE - Supporting Details]
- Background information
- Examples and methodology

[END - Reinforcement]
- Output format
- Final critical requirements
```

### Hierarchical Organization

**Principle**: Use clear hierarchy for complex prompts

**Pattern**:
```
# Level 1: Overall Task

## Level 2: Major Components

### Level 3: Specific Details

- Level 4: Individual items
  - Sub-items with further detail
```

**Benefits**:
- Easier navigation
- Prevents information overload
- Shows relationships between components

### Delimiter Strategy

**Principle**: Use consistent delimiters to separate content types

**Patterns**:
```
Code/Data: ```language\n[content]\n```
XML Tags: <section>[content]</section>
Sections: --- or ***
Headers: # ## ###
```

**When to Use**:
- Mixing instructions with data
- Code or structured data in prompts
- Multiple distinct sections
- Need to prevent injection attacks

### Length Management

**Guidelines**:
- **Short (<200 words)**: Simple, well-defined tasks
- **Medium (200-800 words)**: Most complex tasks
- **Long (>800 words)**: Use hierarchical structure heavily
- **Very Long (>1500 words)**: Consider multi-turn interaction

**Optimization**:
```
Too Long → Break into phases
Too Short → Add necessary context
Just Right → Clear, complete, parsable
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Vague Modifiers

**Bad**: "Quickly analyze this data"
**Why**: "Quickly" is subjective and unhelpful
**Fix**: "Analyze this data within 2 hours" OR just "Analyze this data"

### 2. Contradictory Requirements

**Bad**: "Provide a comprehensive yet brief analysis"
**Why**: Comprehensive and brief conflict
**Fix**: "Provide a brief executive summary (200 words) followed by detailed sections"

### 3. Assumed Knowledge

**Bad**: "Use the usual format"
**Why**: No shared understanding of "usual"
**Fix**: "Use JSON format: {name: string, age: integer, city: string}"

### 4. Vague Directives

**Bad**: "Make it better"
**Why**: No criteria for "better"
**Fix**: "Improve performance by reducing latency below 100ms"

### 5. Ambiguous Pronouns

**Bad**: "Take the data and analyze it. Then visualize it and summarize it."
**Why**: Multiple "it" references are unclear
**Fix**: "Take the data and analyze the trends. Then visualize the trends and summarize key findings."

### 6. Missing Edge Cases

**Bad**: "Extract email addresses from text"
**Why**: Doesn't specify handling for none found, invalid formats
**Fix**: "Extract email addresses. If none found, return empty array. Validate format and exclude malformed addresses."

### 7. No Output Specification

**Bad**: "Analyze sales data"
**Why**: Output format unclear
**Fix**: "Analyze sales data and provide results as JSON: {trends: [], insights: [], recommendations: []}"

Message: "When will my credit card be charged?"
Category: billing_question
Confidence: 0.90

Message: "Can you add dark mode?"
Category: feature_request
Confidence: 0.85

Message: "What are your business hours?"
Category: general_inquiry
Confidence: 0.80

Now classify:
[customer message]

Output format:
{
  "category": "[category]",

```

**Problems**:
- No review criteria
- Vague "issues"
- No prioritization
- Missing actionable feedback

**Results**: Generic comments, missed critical bugs

**Improved Prompt (v7)**:
```
Perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:

1. **Correctness** (CRITICAL)
   - Logic errors
   - Edge case handling
   - Type safety

2. **Security** (CRITICAL)
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection risks
   - XSS vulnerabilities

3. **Performance** (HIGH)
   - Algorithm efficiency
   - Database query optimization
   - Memory usage

4. **Maintainability** (MEDIUM)
   - Code organization
   - Documentation
   - Naming conventions

For each issue found, provide:

**Severity**: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
**Issue**: [One-line description]
**Location**: [File:Line or function name]
**Explanation**: [Why this is a problem]
**Recommendation**: [Specific fix with code example]
**Testing**: [How to verify the fix]

Example:

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: SQL injection vulnerability
**Location**: user_service.py:45
**Explanation**: User input directly concatenated into SQL query
**Recommendation**:
```python
# Bad
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Good
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```
**Testing**: Test with input: "1 OR 1=1", should be treated as literal string

Now review this code:
[code to review]
```

**Results**: 88% bug detection, actionable feedback, proper prioritization

**Key Improvements**:
1. Clear review dimensions with priority
2. Structured output format
