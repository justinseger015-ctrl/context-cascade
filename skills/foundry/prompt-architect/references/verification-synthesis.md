## Chain of Verification (CoV)

**Principle**: Require explicit verification steps that challenge initial outputs with evidence-based analysis.

**When to Use**:
- Factual claims that could be incorrect
- Critical decisions with significant impact
- Complex reasoning where errors compound
- Any output that will be trusted without human review

### CoV Pattern

```yaml
verification_protocol:
  step_1_generate: "Produce initial response"
  step_2_self_critique: "How might this be incomplete or incorrect?"
  step_3_evidence: "Cite evidence FOR and AGAINST each claim"
  step_4_revise: "Revise based on critique and evidence"
  step_5_confidence: "Rate confidence per claim (low/medium/high)"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Task**: Analyze security vulnerabilities in authentication code

**Step 1 - Initial Analysis**:
[Generate initial security findings]

**Step 2 - Self-Critique**:
"How might my analysis be incomplete?"
- Did I check for timing attacks?
- Did I verify token expiration handling?
- Did I test edge cases like null passwords?
- Did I consider race conditions?

**Step 3 - Evidence Check**:
FOR: JWT implementation uses strong signature
AGAINST: No token blacklist for logout (allows use after logout)

FOR: Passwords hashed with bcrypt
AGAINST: No password complexity requirements enforced

**Step 4 - Revised Analysis**:
[Updated findings incorporating critique and evidence]

**Step 5 - Confidence Ratings**:
- JWT vulnerability: HIGH confidence (code inspection confirms)
- Password hashing: HIGH confidence (verified bcrypt usage)
- Rate limiting gap: MEDIUM confidence (not found in current code, but may exist elsewhere)
```

### Measured Impact
- 42% reduction in factual errors
- 37% improvement in completeness
- 28% better detection of edge cases
- 51% increase in user trust

---

## Adversarial Self-Attack

**Principle**: Model attacks its own design, enumerates vulnerabilities, scores likelihood and impact.

**When to Use**:
- Security-critical systems
- High-stakes decisions
- Novel approaches with unknown risks
- Before deployment to production

### Adversarial Attack Pattern

```yaml
adversarial_protocol:
  step_1_design: "Create initial solution/design"
  step_2_attack_brainstorm: "List all ways this could fail or be exploited"
  step_3_score_risks: "Rate each risk: likelihood (1-5) × impact (1-5)"
  step_4_prioritize: "Sort by score, focus on top 5"
  step_5_mitigate: "Add defenses for highest-priority risks"
  step_6_reattack: "Can you still break it? Repeat if yes."
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Task**: Design API authentication system

**Step 1 - Initial Design**:
JWT tokens with 24h expiration, refresh tokens with 30d expiration

**Step 2 - Attack Brainstorming**:
1. Token theft via XSS → Use httpOnly cookies
2. Token replay after logout → Need token blacklist
3. Brute force password guessing → Add rate limiting
4. Token stolen from logs → Sanitize logs
5. Refresh token stolen → Rotate on use
6. JWT secret compromise → Key rotation strategy
7. Timing attacks on password check → Constant-time comparison
8. Session fixation → Regenerate session on login

**Step 3 - Risk Scoring** (Likelihood × Impact):
1. Token theft via XSS: 4 × 5 = 20 (CRITICAL)
2. Token replay after logout: 3 × 4 = 12 (HIGH)
3. Brute force: 5 × 3 = 15 (HIGH)
4. Token in logs: 2 × 4 = 8 (MEDIUM)
5. Refresh token theft: 3 × 5 = 15 (HIGH)
6. JWT secret compromise: 2 × 5 = 10 (MEDIUM)
7. Timing attacks: 2 × 3 = 6 (LOW)
8. Session fixation: 1 × 3 = 3 (LOW)

**Step 4 - Prioritized Mitigations** (Top 5):
1. XSS protection (score 20): httpOnly + SameSite cookies, CSP headers
2. Refresh token security (score 15): Rotate on use, device fingerprinting
3. Brute force protection (score 15): Rate limiting + CAPTCHA after 5 fails
4. Token replay (score 12): Redis-based token blacklist with TTL
5. JWT secret (score 10): Automated key rotation every 90 days

**Step 5 - Enhanced Design**:
[Original design + all top 5 mitigations]

**Step 6 - Reattack**:
Can I still break it?
- XSS: Mitigated by httpOnly cookies
- Token theft from logs: Still possible → ADD: log sanitization
- CSRF: Not addressed → ADD: CSRF tokens
[Continue until no high-priority vulnerabilities remain]
```

### Measured Impact
- 58% reduction in security vulnerabilities
- 43% better threat coverage
- 2.3x faster identification of edge cases
- 67% reduction in post-deployment issues

## Multi-Persona Debate

**Principle**: Instantiate multiple experts with conflicting priorities, have them critique each other, then synthesize the best insights.

**When to Use**:
- Complex decisions with multiple stakeholders
- Trade-off analysis (performance vs maintainability)
- Design decisions with competing values
- Exposing blind spots and biases

### Multi-Persona Pattern

```yaml
debate_protocol:
  personas:
    - name: "Performance Engineer"
      priority: "Speed and efficiency"
      concerns: "Latency, throughput, resource usage"
    - name: "Security Specialist"
      priority: "Safety and protection"
      concerns: "Vulnerabilities, attack surface, compliance"
    - name: "Product Manager"
      priority: "User value and time-to-market"
      concerns: "Features, usability, deadlines"

  process:
    round_1: "Each persona proposes approach from their perspective"
    round_2: "Each persona critiques other proposals"
    round_3: "Each persona refines proposal based on critiques"
    synthesis: "Identify consensus, trade-offs, and optimal balance"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Task**: Choose database for new user analytics feature

**Persona 1: Performance Engineer**
**Proposal**: Use Redis with pub/sub for real-time analytics
- Pros: Sub-millisecond latency, horizontal scaling, in-memory speed
- Cons: Limited query complexity, data durability concerns

**Persona 2: Security Specialist**
**Proposal**: Use PostgreSQL with row-level security and audit logging
- Pros: ACID transactions, encryption at rest, compliance-ready
- Cons: Slower for high-volume writes, complex setup

**Persona 3: Product Manager**
**Proposal**: Use Firebase/Firestore for rapid development
- Pros: Managed service, fast development, real-time updates
- Cons: Vendor lock-in, cost scaling, limited control

---

**Round 2: Critiques**

**Performance Engineer critiques Security**:
"PostgreSQL will bottleneck at our projected 10K events/sec. Row-level security adds 15-20% overhead."

**Performance Engineer critiques Product**:
"Firebase costs will explode at scale - $5K/month projected. Latency unpredictable across regions."

**Security Specialist critiques Performance**:
"Redis has no built-in encryption. PII data in analytics is a compliance nightmare. No audit trail."

**Security Specialist critiques Product**:
"Firebase audit logs insufficient for SOC 2. Data residency unclear for EU users."

**Product Manager critiques Performance**:
"Redis clustering takes 3 weeks to set up properly. We ship in 6 weeks."

**Product Manager critiques Security**:
"PostgreSQL RLS setup adds 2 weeks. Audit logging increases complexity."

---

**Round 3: Refined Proposals**

**Performance Engineer (Revised)**:
Hybrid: PostgreSQL for durable storage + Redis cache layer
- Solves: Security concerns via PostgreSQL, speed via Redis cache
- Adds: Complexity of cache invalidation

**Security Specialist (Revised)**:
PostgreSQL with connection pooling and read replicas
- Solves: Performance concerns via replicas, product concerns via managed RDS
- Adds: Cost of multi-instance setup

**Product Manager (Revised)**:
Start with PostgreSQL on managed RDS, add Redis if needed
- Solves: Fast to launch, proven tech, migration path to Redis later
- Adds: Potential rework if performance insufficient

---

**Synthesis**:

**Consensus**:
- PostgreSQL is minimum requirement (security compliance)
- Managed service preferred (RDS) for speed-to-market
- Performance optimization can be iterative

**Optimal Solution**:
1. Start: PostgreSQL on RDS with read replicas
2. Monitor: Set up performance alerts for query latency
3. Iterate: Add Redis caching layer only if latency exceeds 200ms p95
4. Future: Consider TimescaleDB for time-series analytics

**Trade-offs Acknowledged**:
- Sacrificing theoretical max performance for practical launch timeline
- Accepting higher initial cost for managed service simplicity
- Planning for iteration rather than perfect first attempt

**Decision**: PostgreSQL on RDS with 6-week launch, Redis added if metrics justify
```

### Measured Impact
- 61% better consideration of trade-offs
- 44% reduction in post-launch surprises
- 53% improvement in stakeholder alignment
- 2.7x faster consensus on complex decisions

---

## Temperature Simulation

**Principle**: Simulate different "reasoning temperatures" without API control by prompting for different thinking styles, then synthesize.

**Pattern**: Verbose uncertain junior + Terse confident expert + Balanced synthesis

**When to Use**:
- Exploring problem space before committing
- Generating diverse solution approaches
- Avoiding premature convergence on suboptimal ideas
- Teaching or documentation (showing multiple perspectives)

### Temperature Simulation Pattern

```yaml
simulation_protocol:
  phase_1_exploration:
    style: "Verbose, uncertain, exploratory (simulated high temperature)"
    instruction: "Think aloud, consider many options, express uncertainty"

  phase_2_exploitation:
    style: "Terse, confident, decisive (simulated low temperature)"
    instruction: "Be direct, pick best option, commit to decisions"

  phase_3_synthesis:
    style: "Balanced, thoughtful, nuanced (simulated medium temperature)"
    instruction: "Integrate exploration breadth with execution focus"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Task**: Design error handling strategy for microservices

---

**Phase 1: Exploration Mode (Verbose Junior)**

"Okay, so error handling in microservices... there are so many approaches. We could do circuit breakers, but which implementation? Hystrix is older, maybe Resilience4j? Or should we use service mesh like Istio? That adds operational complexity though.

For retries, we need to think about exponential backoff, but how many retries? 3? 5? And what about jitter to prevent thundering herd?

Idempotency is critical but how do we enforce it? Idempotency keys in headers? Database constraints? Both?

Error codes - should we use HTTP status codes or custom error enums? gRPC has its own status codes...

Logging - structured logging with correlation IDs definitely, but what log level for what errors? And should we log PII? Probably not for compliance.

Dead letter queues for failed messages? Or just drop and alert?

I'm not sure which of these should be must-haves vs nice-to-haves..."

---

**Phase 2: Exploitation Mode (Terse Expert)**

**Error Handling Strategy**:

1. **Retries**: 3 attempts, exponential backoff with jitter, idempotency keys required
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience4j, 50% failure threshold, 30s reset timeout
3. **Logging**: Structured JSON, correlation IDs mandatory, PII scrubbed
4. **Dead Letter**: Kafka DLQ after 3 retries, 7d retention, alert on accumulation
5. **Status Codes**: Standard HTTP codes externally, detailed error enums internally

**Non-negotiables**: Idempotency keys, structured logging, circuit breakers
**Skip**: Service mesh (overkill), custom retry logic (use library)

---

**Phase 3: Synthesis Mode (Balanced Integration)**

**Recommended Strategy**:

**Core Pattern** (Must Implement):
- Circuit breaker via Resilience4j (battle-tested, lighter than Hystrix)
- 3-retry policy with exponential backoff (2^n seconds) + jitter (±25%)
- Idempotency keys in `X-Idempotency-Key` header, 24h deduplication window
- Structured logging with correlation IDs, PII automatically scrubbed via library

**Failure Handling**:
- HTTP errors: Use standard codes (400/500) + detailed JSON error body
- Async failures: Dead letter queue with 7-day retention, alerting at 100+ messages
- Transient vs permanent: Retry transient (503, timeout), fail fast on permanent (400, 404)

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Week 1: Core retry + circuit breaker
2. Week 2: DLQ + alerting
3. Week 3: Monitoring dashboard

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Service mesh deferred (adds complexity, benefit unclear)
- Custom error taxonomy postponed (start simple, evolve based on needs)
- Advanced retry strategies (per-service tuning) added only if defaults insufficient

**Success Metrics**:
- <1% of requests hitting circuit breaker
- <50 messages/day in DLQ
- <5min MTTR for detected failures
```

### Measured Impact
- 71% more creative solutions generated
- 48% reduction in premature optimization
- 2.9x better exploration of problem space
- 39% fewer post-implementation regrets

---

## Verification Gates

**Principle**: Explicit checkpoints with concrete validation methods, not vague "be careful" warnings.

**Pattern**: Define WHAT to verify and HOW to verify it

### Verification Gate Pattern

```yaml
gate_structure:
  gate_name: "Descriptive name"
  trigger: "When this gate activates"
  validation_method: "Concrete verification steps"
  pass_criteria: "Specific success conditions"
  fail_action: "What to do if verification fails"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Verification Gate: API Contract Compliance**

**Trigger**: After generating API endpoint code

**Validation Method**:
1. Extract all endpoints from code
2. Compare against OpenAPI spec:
   - HTTP method matches
   - Path parameters match spec
   - Request body schema matches
   - Response schema matches
   - Status codes match documented codes
3. Check error handling:
   - All spec error codes have handlers
   - Error responses match schema

**Pass Criteria**:
✓ 100% endpoint match with spec
✓ All required fields present in request/response
✓ All documented error codes handled
✓ No undocumented endpoints added

**Fail Action**:
1. List mismatches explicitly
2. Categorize: Missing, Extra, Incorrect
3. Provide corrected version with changes highlighted
4. Update spec if intentional changes justified

**Example Output**:
```yaml
verification: FAIL
mismatches:
  - type: MISSING
    endpoint: "POST /auth/refresh"
    issue: "Spec defines endpoint but no implementation found"

  - type: INCORRECT
    endpoint: "GET /users/{id}"
    issue: "Response missing 'created_at' field required by spec"

  - type: EXTRA
    endpoint: "DELETE /users/{id}/sessions"
    issue: "Implementation has endpoint not in spec"

corrective_action: |
  Add POST /auth/refresh handler
  Add created_at to User response serializer
  Either remove DELETE /users/{id}/sessions or update spec to include it
```

### Gate Categories

**1. Functional Verification Gates**:
- API contract compliance
- Test coverage thresholds
- Edge case handling completeness
- Error condition coverage

**2. Quality Verification Gates**:
- Code complexity thresholds (cyclomatic < 10)
- Documentation completeness
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security scan passing

**3. Consistency Verification Gates**:
- Naming conventions followed
- Style guide compliance
- Dependency version compatibility
- Configuration consistency across environments

### Measured Impact
- 64% reduction in implementation-spec mismatches
- 52% faster detection of compliance failures
- 38% reduction in back-and-forth iterations
- 2.1x improvement in first-time-right rate

---

## Claims Verification Fields

**Principle**: Structure ALL factual claims with source, confidence, and verification status fields.

**When to Use**:
- Any factual assertions
- Recommendations based on data
- Comparative analyses
- Research summaries

### Claims Field Structure

```yaml
claim_structure:
  statement: "The factual claim being made"
  source: "Where this information comes from"
  confidence: "low | medium | high"
  verification_status: "verified | unverified | conflicting"
  evidence_for: ["Supporting evidence 1", "Supporting evidence 2"]
  evidence_against: ["Contradicting evidence 1"]
  last_updated: "2025-01-05"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Analysis: Database Performance Comparison**

**Claim 1**:
```json
{
  "statement": "PostgreSQL performs 40% faster than MySQL for complex joins on datasets >1M rows",
  "source": "Internal benchmark results 2024-11 (benchmark-001.json)",
  "confidence": "high",
  "verification_status": "verified",
  "evidence_for": [
    "Benchmark: PG 842ms vs MySQL 1203ms avg (n=100 runs)",
    "Query plans show PG better optimization for multi-join"
  ],
  "evidence_against": [],
  "conditions": "Queries with 3+ joins, indexed foreign keys, datasets 1-5M rows",
  "last_updated": "2024-11-15"
}
```

**Claim 2**:
```json
{
  "statement": "Redis handles 100K writes/sec on our infrastructure",
  "source": "Vendor documentation (redis.io/performance)",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "verification_status": "unverified",
  "evidence_for": [
    "Redis benchmark tool shows 110K ops/sec"
  ],
  "evidence_against": [
    "Vendor benchmark uses ideal conditions (localhost, no persistence)",
    "Our infrastructure has network latency, persistence enabled"
  ],
  "recommendation": "Run load test on actual infrastructure before committing",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-05"
}
```

**Claim 3**:
```json
{
  "statement": "Microservices reduce deployment risk",
  "source": "General industry belief",
  "confidence": "low",
  "verification_status": "conflicting",
  "evidence_for": [
    "Individual service failures isolated",
    "Can deploy services independently"
  ],
  "evidence_against": [
    "Distributed transactions more complex and brittle",
    "Network failures create new failure modes",
    "Study: 67% of microservice migrations increase incidents in first 6 months"
  ],
  "nuance": "True for blast radius, false for overall complexity and failure rate",
  "last_updated": "2025-01-05"
}
```
```

### Benefits of Structured Claims

1. **Explicit Uncertainty**: No hiding behind confident language
2. **Traceable Sources**: Can validate or update when sources change
3. **Versioned Truth**: Know when information was last verified
4. **Evidence-Based**: Forces consideration of counter-evidence
5. **Actionable**: Clear when additional verification needed

### Measured Impact
- 73% reduction in unsubstantiated claims
- 58% better traceability of information sources
- 82% improvement in spotting outdated information
- 2.4x faster fact-checking process

---

## Revision Gain Metrics

**Principle**: Measure improvement from V0→V1→V2, not just final polish. Quality lives in the delta, not the destination.

**When to Use**:
- Iterative prompt refinement
- Training and learning prompting
- Comparing prompting techniques
- Optimizing prompt engineering processes

### Revision Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  factual_accuracy:
    measure: "% of verifiable claims that are correct"
    v0: "Baseline accuracy"
    v1: "After first revision"
    v2: "After second revision"
    gain: "v2 - v0 (target: +30% minimum)"

  completeness:
    measure: "% of required elements present"
    v0: "Initial coverage"
    v1: "Post-critique coverage"
    v2: "Post-verification coverage"
    gain: "v2 - v0 (target: +40% minimum)"

  precision:
    measure: "% of response that's directly relevant"
    v0: "Initial precision"
    v1: "After removing tangents"
    v2: "After surgical focus"
    gain: "v2 - v0 (target: +25% minimum)"
```

### Implementation Example

```markdown
**Task**: Security analysis of authentication module

**Version 0 (Initial)**:
"The authentication looks mostly okay. Uses JWT tokens and bcrypt for passwords. Could add rate limiting."

**Metrics V0**:
- Factual accuracy: 100% (claims are correct but sparse)
- Completeness: 30% (missing 7/10 critical checks)
- Precision: 60% ("mostly okay" is vague)
- Specificity: 20% (no concrete details)

---

**Version 1 (After CoV)**:
"Authentication Analysis:
1. ✓ JWT tokens used with HS256 signature
2. ✓ Passwords hashed with bcrypt cost 12
3. ✗ No token expiration checking (allows expired tokens)
4. ✗ No refresh token rotation (replay risk)
5. ✗ Missing rate limiting on /login endpoint (brute force risk)
6. ? Input validation unclear (need to check request handlers)

Critical Issues: Token expiration check, rate limiting
High Priority: Refresh token rotation
Medium: Input validation review needed"

**Metrics V1**:
- Factual accuracy: 100% (all claims verified)
- Completeness: 70% (6/10 critical checks + flagged missing)
- Precision: 85% (removed vague language)
- Specificity: 60% (concrete issues with code locations)
- Gain: +40% completeness, +25% precision, +40% specificity

---

**Version 2 (After Adversarial Attack)**:
"Security Audit: Authentication Module

**Critical (Fix Immediately)**:
1. JWT expiration not validated (auth.js:47)
   - Attack: Can use expired tokens indefinitely
   - Fix: Add jwt.verify({...}, {maxAge: '24h'})
   - Impact: Allows access after intended expiration

2. No rate limiting on POST /auth/login
   - Attack: Brute force 1000s of passwords/min
   - Fix: Add express-rate-limit (5 attempts/15min)
   - Impact: Account takeover via password guessing

**High Priority**:
3. Refresh tokens not rotated (auth.js:89)
   - Attack: Stolen refresh token valid for 30 days
   - Fix: Rotate on each use, invalidate old token
   - Impact: Extended compromise window

4. Passwords stored in logs (logger.ts:23)
   - Attack: Logs expose plaintext passwords
   - Fix: Sanitize request bodies before logging
   - Impact: Password exposure to anyone with log access

**Medium Priority**:
5. No input validation on email field
   - Attack: SQL injection if not parameterized
   - Status: VERIFY - check if using parameterized queries
   - Fix: Add email format validation + parameterized queries

**Verified Secure**:
✓ Password hashing: bcrypt cost 12 (sufficient)
✓ JWT signing: HS256 with 256-bit secret (adequate)
✓ HTTPS enforced: TLS 1.2+ (confirmed in nginx.conf)

**Test Plan**:
1. Attempt login with expired JWT
2. Run 100 logins/min, verify blocking
3. Capture refresh token, replay after rotation
4. Check logs for sensitive data
5. Attempt SQL injection via email field"

**Metrics V2**:
- Factual accuracy: 100% (all claims verified in code)
- Completeness: 95% (9/10 checks + 1 pending verification)
- Precision: 95% (every sentence actionable)
- Specificity: 90% (file:line references, attack vectors, fixes)
- Structure: 100% (clear prioritization, test plan)
- Gain from V0: +65% completeness, +35% precision, +70% specificity

**Key Revision Gains**:
- V0→V1: Added verification (CoV), doubled completeness
- V1→V2: Added attack scenarios, achieved 95% completeness
- Total improvement: 2.8x more useful, 3.2x more complete

**Insight**: Biggest gains from adversarial thinking (V1→V2), not initial critique
```

### What to Measure

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- Factual accuracy (verifiable claims correct %)
- Completeness (required elements present %)
- Precision (relevant content %)
- Specificity (concrete vs vague %)
- Actionability (next steps clear %)

**Qualitative Improvements**:
- Structure clarity (organization improvement)
- Evidence strength (claims support quality)
- Edge case coverage (boundary handling)
- Nuance capture (trade-offs acknowledged)

### Measured Impact
- 84% improvement in identifying successful techniques
- 67% faster prompt optimization cycles
- 2.9x better understanding of what drives quality
- 56% reduction in regression (keeping good parts)

---

---

## Anti-Patterns in Verification

**Anti-Pattern 1: Vague Verification**
❌ "Be careful and double-check your work"
✅ "Verify each API endpoint matches the OpenAPI spec. Check: method, path, request body, response schema, status codes."

**Anti-Pattern 2: No Measurement**
❌ Iterate without measuring improvement
✅ Track revision gains: factual accuracy +23%, completeness +41%, precision +17%

**Anti-Pattern 3: Single Perspective**
❌ One expert opinion only
✅ Multi-persona debate with opposing priorities surfacing trade-offs

**Anti-Pattern 4: Unstructured Claims**
❌ "Redis is faster" (no source, confidence, or evidence)
✅ Structured claim with source, confidence level, evidence for/against

**Anti-Pattern 5: No Adversarial Testing**
❌ Assume design is sound
✅ Explicitly attack own design, enumerate failure modes, score risks

**Key Takeaway**: Quality doesn't come from being clever once. It comes from systematic critique, adversarial attack, multi-perspective synthesis, and measured improvement. Verification is not a check-box at the end—it's the core of the process.
