sleep 5
curl http://localhost:8000/health
docker stop test-api && docker rm test-api

# Test local development
poetry install

- [ ] Integration tests

**Validation**:
```bash
cd complex-go-service

# Test Docker build
docker build -t complex-go-service:test .
docker images complex-go-service:test --format "{{.Size}}"  # Should be < 20MB

# Test application
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name test-svc complex-go-service:test
sleep 3
curl http://localhost:8080/health
docker stop test-svc && docker rm test-svc

# Test local development
go mod download
go test ./...
go test -cover ./...
golangci-lint run
```

**Scenario**: Developer clones template and starts development

```bash
# Generate project
python resources/scripts/init_project.py
# (Use all features)

cd generated-project

# Install dependencies
[npm install | poetry install | go mod download]

# Make a code change
echo "console.log('test');" >> src/index.js  # Or equivalent

# Run quality checks
[npm run lint | poetry run ruff check . | golangci-lint run]

# Run tests
[npm test | poetry run pytest | go test ./...]

# Build Docker image
docker build -t test:latest .

# Run in Docker
docker run -d -p PORT:PORT test:latest

# Test endpoint
curl http://localhost:PORT/health

# Stop container
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=test:latest)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] All steps complete without errors
- [ ] Application runs in Docker
- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Code quality checks pass

## Notes

- Test should complete in < 10 minutes
- Docker builds may take longer on first run (downloads)
- CI/CD workflows can be tested locally with `act`
- All generated projects should be immediately usable
