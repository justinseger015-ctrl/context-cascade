## When to Use This Skill

- **Tool Usage**: When you need to execute specific tools, lookup reference materials, or run automation pipelines
- **Reference Lookup**: When you need to access documented patterns, best practices, or technical specifications
- **Automation Needs**: When you need to run standardized workflows or pipeline processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Manual Processes**: Avoid when manual intervention is more appropriate than automated tools
- **Non-Standard Tools**: Do not use when tools are deprecated, unsupported, or outside standard toolkit

## Success Criteria

- **Tool Executed Correctly**: Verify tool runs without errors and produces expected output
- **Reference Accurate**: Confirm reference material is current and applicable
- **Pipeline Complete**: Ensure automation pipeline completes all stages successfully

## Edge Cases

- **Tool Unavailable**: Handle scenarios where required tool is not installed or accessible
- **Outdated References**: Detect when reference material is obsolete or superseded
- **Pipeline Failures**: Recover gracefully from mid-pipeline failures with clear error messages

## Guardrails

- **NEVER use deprecated tools**: Always verify tool versions and support status before execution
- **ALWAYS verify outputs**: Validate tool outputs match expected format and content
- **ALWAYS check health**: Run tool health checks before critical operations

## Evidence-Based Validation

- **Tool Health Checks**: Execute diagnostic commands to verify tool functionality before use
- **Output Validation**: Compare actual outputs against expected schemas or patterns
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution metrics and success rates

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Batch**: 2 of 7 (Skills 16-30)
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Pass Rate**: 2/15 (13.3%)

---

## Executive Summary

Batch 2 encountered significant structural challenges due to incomplete agent instructions and MECE cleanup conflicts. While agent execution was successful (15/15 agents completed), audit validation revealed critical gaps in:

1. **Missing examples/ directory in initial instructions** (forgot to include in agent prompts)
2. **Container/aggregator skills** with nested structures conflicting with MECE cleanup
3. **Parent-level file requirements** not validated before cleanup

**Key Finding**: Cleanup script correctly removed legacy nested structures but left some skills without parent-level skill.md/README.md files because those files never existed at parent level.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incomplete Agent Instructions (Critical)

**Problem**: Original agent spawning instructions for Batch 2 did NOT include examples/ directory requirement.

**What was sent**:
```
### 1. Create resources/ Structure
- resources/README.md
- resources/scripts/ (2-4 automation scripts)
- resources/templates/ (2-3 templates)

### 2. Create tests/ Directory
- tests/test-1-basic.md
- tests/test-2-edge-cases.md
- tests/test-3-integration.md
```

**What was missing**:
```
### 3. Create examples/ Directory  <-- THIS WAS FORGOTTEN!
- examples/example-1-{topic}.md
- examples/example-2-{topic}.md
- examples/example-3-{topic}.md
```

**Impact**: All 13 skills that didn't have examples/ failed initial audit. Had to spawn 13 additional agents to add examples/ retroactively.

**Lesson Learned**: Agent instructions MUST be comprehensive and match audit requirements exactly. Use checklist validation before spawning agents.

### Issue 2: MECE Cleanup vs Container Skills (Critical)

**Problem**: Cleanup script correctly removed legacy nested skill directories (following MECE principles), but some skills had ONLY nested files with no parent-level skill.md/README.md.

**Affected Skills**:
- `dependencies/` - had `when-mapping-dependencies-use-dependency-mapper/SKILL.md` but no parent `skill.md`
- `documentation/` - had `when-documenting-code-use-doc-generator/SKILL.md` but no parent `skill.md`
- `database-specialists/` - had `sql-database-specialist/skill.md` but no parent `skill.md`

**Cleanup Actions** (correct per MECE principles):
```
DELETE: when-mapping-dependencies-use-dependency-mapper/ (legacy nested structure)
DELETE: when-documenting-code-use-doc-generator/ (legacy nested structure)
PRESERVE: sql-database-specialist/ (specialist subdirectory)
```

**Result**: Skills left as empty shells with only examples/

**Lesson Learned**: Before cleanup, verify parent-level skill.md and README.md exist. If they don't, either:
1. Promote files from nested subdirectory to parent, OR
2. Recognize skill as aggregator/container and structure accordingly

### Issue 3: Naming Inconsistencies (Medium)

**Problem**: Some skills use `SKILL.md` instead of `skill.md` (case mismatch).

**Affected**: flow-nexus-swarm, github-multi-repo, github-integration

**Impact**: Audit script looks for lowercase `skill.md` specifically.

**Lesson Learned**: Enforce lowercase naming convention via validation step before audit.

### Issue 4: Missing README.md Files (Medium)

**Problem**: Several skills have skill.md but missing README.md at parent level.

**Affected**: feature-dev-complete, github-code-review, frontend-specialists

**Impact**: Structure score penalized (README.md is required component).

**Lesson Learned**: Agent instructions must explicitly require BOTH skill.md AND README.md creation.

## Corrected Agent Instructions for Batches 3-7

### ✅ Complete Agent Instruction Template

```javascript
Task("Enhance {skill-name} to Gold tier",
  "Enhance the skill '{skill-name}' from Silver to Gold tier by adding Gold tier components.

  **Template**: C:\Users\17175\claude-code-plugins\ruv-sparc-three-loop-system\skills\skill-forge
  **Location**: C:\Users\17175\claude-code-plugins\ruv-sparc-three-loop-system\skills\{skill-name}

  **Your Task**: Add Gold tier components to achieve 12+ files total.

  ### 1. Create resources/ Structure
  - resources/README.md (or readme.md)
  - resources/scripts/ (2-4 automation scripts: {skill-specific}.py, {tool}.sh, {feature}.js)
  - resources/templates/ (2-3 templates: config.yaml, template.json, example.sql)

  ### 2. Create tests/ Directory
  - tests/test-1-basic.md
  - tests/test-2-edge-cases.md
  - tests/test-3-integration.md

  ### 3. Create examples/ Directory (REQUIRED!)  <-- ADDED THIS!
  - examples/example-1-{topic}.md (150-300 lines, scenario + walkthrough + code + outcomes + tips)
  - examples/example-2-{topic}.md (150-300 lines)
  - examples/example-3-{topic}.md (150-300 lines, optional but recommended)

  ### 4. Verify Parent-Level Files (CRITICAL!)  <-- ADDED THIS!
  - Ensure skill.md exists at parent level (NOT just in subdirectories)
  - Ensure README.md exists at parent level
  - If files only exist in nested subdirectories, promote them to parent

  ### 5. CRITICAL: Preserve Existing Files
  - DO NOT modify existing skill.md, README.md, references/, graphviz/
  - ONLY add new directories: resources/, tests/, examples/
  - If nested specialist subdirectories exist (e.g., sql-database-specialist/), preserve them

  ### 6. Quality Standards
  - All scripts must be functional (not placeholders), 50-200 lines each
  - All templates must be valid and useful, proper syntax
  - All tests must be specific to {skill-name} use cases, comprehensive scenarios
  - All examples must have: scenario, walkthrough, code, outcomes, tips
  - Follow skill-forge structure exactly

  ### 7. Naming Conventions (STRICT!)  <-- ADDED THIS!
  - Use lowercase: skill.md (not SKILL.md)
  - Use lowercase: readme.md or README.md (both acceptable)
  - Use lowercase directory names

  ",
  "general-purpose")
```

## Action Items for Batches 3-7

### Pre-Flight Checklist (Before Spawning Agents):

1. ✅ **Verify agent instructions include examples/**
2. ✅ **Check for container/aggregator skills** (nested subdirectories)
3. ✅ **Validate parent-level skill.md and README.md exist**
4. ✅ **Review naming conventions** (lowercase enforcement)
5. ✅ **Test on 1-2 skills first** before full batch

### During Execution:

1. ✅ **Monitor agent progress** for structural issues
2. ✅ **Check first 3 agent completions** before continuing with remaining 12
3. ✅ **Run quick validation** on completed skills before cleanup

### Post-Execution:

1. ✅ **Cleanup with MECE validation** (check parent files exist before removing nested)
2. ✅ **Audit immediately after cleanup** (while files fresh)
3. ✅ **Address NO-GO skills within same batch** (don't carry forward)

## Estimated Impact on Remaining Batches

**If we apply all lessons learned**:

| Batch | Skills | Est. Pass Rate | Est. Duration | Confidence |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| 3 | 15 | 90-95% | 40 min | High (with checklist) |
| 4 | 15 | 90-95% | 40 min | High |
| 5 | 15 | 90-95% | 40 min | High |
| 6 | 15 | 90-95% | 40 min | High |
| 7 | 9 | 90-95% | 30 min | High |
| **Total** | **69** | **~93%** | **~3.5 hours** | **High** |

**Total campaign**: 99 skills, ~4-5 hours (vs original 33+ hours sequential)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Batch 2 Fix):

**Option A: Accept Partial Success (RECOMMENDED)**
- Accept 2 GO skills (compliance, debugging) as successful
- Document 13 NO-GO skills as "needs parent-level files"
- Apply lessons to Batches 3-7 for 90%+ success rate
- **Time**: 0 hours (move forward)
- **ROI**: Focus effort on remaining 69 skills with improved process

**Option B: Complete Batch 2 Fix**
- Create parent-level skill.md and README.md for 9 empty skills
- Fix naming issues (SKILL.md → skill.md) for 4 skills
- Re-audit all 15 skills
- **Time**: ~1-2 hours
- **ROI**: 15/15 GO but delays Batches 3-7

### Long-Term:

1. **Update audit script** to provide clearer error messages for missing parent files
2. **Add pre-flight validation** script that checks structure before spawning agents
3. **Create container skill template** for aggregator skills with nested specialists
4. **Implement progressive validation** (check first 3 agents before continuing)

---

## Files Generated This Batch

**Successful**:
- `compliance/*` (18 files) ✅
- `debugging/*` (20 files) ✅

**Partial** (examples/ added but structural issues remain):
- 13 skills with examples/ directories (39 example files, ~10,000+ lines total)

**Reports**:
- `BATCH-2-LESSONS-LEARNED.md` (this document)

---

## Conclusion

Batch 2 highlighted critical gaps in agent instruction completeness and MECE cleanup validation. While the execution was technically successful (all agents completed), the audit validation revealed structural issues that prevented 86.7% of skills from passing.

**Key Takeaway**: Agent instructions must be exhaustively comprehensive and validated against audit requirements before execution. The 2.5 hours spent on Batch 2 troubleshooting is valuable learning that will save 10+ hours across Batches 3-7.

**Recommendation**: Accept the 13.3% pass rate for Batch 2, document lessons learned, and proceed to Batch 3 with corrected instructions. The improved process should yield 90-95% pass rates going forward.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this lessons learned document
2. Update agent instruction template with all corrections
3. Test updated template on 2-3 skills from Batch 3
4. Proceed with full Batch 3 execution using validated instructions
