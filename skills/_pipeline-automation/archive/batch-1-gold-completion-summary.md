## When to Use This Skill

- **Tool Usage**: When you need to execute specific tools, lookup reference materials, or run automation pipelines
- **Reference Lookup**: When you need to access documented patterns, best practices, or technical specifications
- **Automation Needs**: When you need to run standardized workflows or pipeline processes

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Manual Processes**: Avoid when manual intervention is more appropriate than automated tools
- **Non-Standard Tools**: Do not use when tools are deprecated, unsupported, or outside standard toolkit

## Success Criteria

- **Tool Executed Correctly**: Verify tool runs without errors and produces expected output
- **Reference Accurate**: Confirm reference material is current and applicable
- **Pipeline Complete**: Ensure automation pipeline completes all stages successfully

## Edge Cases

- **Tool Unavailable**: Handle scenarios where required tool is not installed or accessible
- **Outdated References**: Detect when reference material is obsolete or superseded
- **Pipeline Failures**: Recover gracefully from mid-pipeline failures with clear error messages

## Guardrails

- **NEVER use deprecated tools**: Always verify tool versions and support status before execution
- **ALWAYS verify outputs**: Validate tool outputs match expected format and content
- **ALWAYS check health**: Run tool health checks before critical operations

## Evidence-Based Validation

- **Tool Health Checks**: Execute diagnostic commands to verify tool functionality before use
- **Output Validation**: Compare actual outputs against expected schemas or patterns
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track pipeline execution metrics and success rates
