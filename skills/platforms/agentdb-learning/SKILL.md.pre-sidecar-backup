## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local-only operations with no vector search needs
- Simple key-value storage without semantic similarity
- Real-time streaming data without persistence requirements
- Operations that do not require embedding-based retrieval

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] Vector search query latency: <10ms for 99th percentile [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Embedding generation: <100ms per document [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Index build time: <1s per 1000 vectors [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Recall@10: >0.95 for similar documents [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Database connection success rate: >99.9% [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Memory footprint: <2GB for 1M vectors with quantization [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: AgentDB local instances have no rate limits; cloud deployments may vary
- **Connection Failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Index Corruption**: Maintain backup indices; rebuild from source if corrupted
- **Memory Overflow**: Use quantization (4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce memory by 4-32x
- **Stale Embeddings**: Implement TTL-based refresh for dynamic content
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Validate embedding dimensions (384 for sentence-transformers) before insertion

## Guardrails & Safety
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: expose database connection strings in logs or error messages [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate vector dimensions before insertion [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: sanitize metadata to prevent injection attacks [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: store PII in vector metadata without encryption [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: implement access control for multi-tenant deployments [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate search results before returning to users [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify database health: Check connection status and index integrity
- Validate search quality: Measure recall/precision on test queries
- Monitor performance: Track query latency, throughput, and memory usage
- Test failure recovery: Simulate connection drops and index corruption
- Benchmark improvements: Compare against baseline metrics (e.g., 150x speedup claim)

## What This Skill Does

**Use this skill to** create, train, and deploy learning plugins for autonomous agents using AgentDB's 9 reinforcement learning algorithms. **Implement** offline RL (Decision Transformer) for safe learning from logged experiences. **Apply** value-based learning (Q-Learning) for discrete actions. **Deploy** policy gradients (Actor-Critic) for continuous control. **Enable** agents to improve through experience with WASM-accelerated neural inference.

**Performance**: Train models 10-100x faster with WASM-accelerated neural inference.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- AgentDB v1.0.7+ (via agentic-flow)
- Basic understanding of reinforcement learning (recommended)

## Quick Start with CLI

### Create Learning Plugin

```bash
# Interactive wizard
npx agentdb@latest create-plugin

# Use specific template
npx agentdb@latest create-plugin -t decision-transformer -n my-agent

# Preview without creating
npx agentdb@latest create-plugin -t q-learning --dry-run

# Custom output directory
npx agentdb@latest create-plugin -t actor-critic -o ./plugins
```
