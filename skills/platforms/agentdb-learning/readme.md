  await adapter.insertPattern({
    id: '',
    type: 'experience',
    domain: 'game-playing',
    pattern_data: JSON.stringify({
      embedding: await computeEmbedding(JSON.stringify({ state, action })),
      pattern: { state, action, reward, next_state, done }
    }),
    confidence: reward > 0 ? 0.9 : 0.5,

// { loss: 0.023, valLoss: 0.028, duration: 1523ms, epochs: 50 }

// 4. Use learned policy for inference
const queryEmbedding = await computeEmbedding(JSON.stringify(currentState));
const result = await adapter.retrieveWithReasoning(queryEmbedding, {
  domain: 'game-playing',
  k: 10,
  synthesizeContext: true,
});

const bestAction = result.memories[0].pattern.action;
console.log('Recommended Action:', bestAction);
```

## Training Workflow

### Phase 1: Experience Collection

```typescript
// Collect experiences during agent execution
const experiences = [];

for (let episode = 0; episode < 1000; episode++) {
  let state = env.reset();
  let done = false;

  while (!done) {
    const action = selectAction(state, epsilon);
    const { next_state, reward, done } = env.step(action);

    experiences.push({ state, action, reward, next_state, done });

    // Store in AgentDB
    await adapter.insertPattern({
      id: '',
      type: 'experience',
      domain: 'task-domain',
      pattern_data: JSON.stringify({
        embedding: await computeEmbedding(JSON.stringify({ state, action })),
        pattern: { state, action, reward, next_state, done }
      }),
      confidence: reward > 0 ? 0.9 : 0.5,
      usage_count: 1,
      success_count: reward > 0 ? 1 : 0,
      created_at: Date.now(),
      last_used: Date.now(),
    });

    state = next_state;
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Model Training

```typescript
// Train on collected experiences
const trainingMetrics = await adapter.train({
  epochs: 100,
  batchSize: 64,
  learningRate: 0.001,
  validationSplit: 0.2,
});

console.log('Training Results:', {
  finalLoss: trainingMetrics.loss,
  validationLoss: trainingMetrics.valLoss,
  trainingTime: trainingMetrics.duration + 'ms',
  totalEpochs: trainingMetrics.epochs
});
```

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Deployment

```typescript
// Evaluate learned policy
const testResults = [];

for (let testEpisode = 0; testEpisode < 100; testEpisode++) {
  let state = env.reset();
  let totalReward = 0;
  let done = false;

  while (!done) {
    // Retrieve best action from learned policy
    const queryEmbedding = await computeEmbedding(JSON.stringify(state));
    const result = await adapter.retrieveWithReasoning(queryEmbedding, {
      domain: 'task-domain',
      k: 10,
      synthesizeContext: true,
    });

    const action = result.memories[0].pattern.action;
    const { next_state, reward, done } = env.step(action);

    totalReward += reward;
    state = next_state;
  }

  testResults.push(totalReward);
}

const avgReward = testResults.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / testResults.length;
console.log('Average Test Reward:', avgReward);
```

## Advanced Training Techniques

### Experience Replay (Breaks Correlation)

```typescript
// Store experiences in circular buffer
class ReplayBuffer {
  constructor(capacity = 10000) {
    this.buffer = [];
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.position = 0;
  }

  push(experience) {
    if (this.buffer.length < this.capacity) {
      this.buffer.push(experience);
    } else {
      this.buffer[this.position] = experience;
    }
    this.position = (this.position + 1) % this.capacity;
  }

  sample(batchSize) {
    const indices = Array.from({length: batchSize}, () =>
      Math.floor(Math.random() * this.buffer.length)
    );
    return indices.map(i => this.buffer[i]);
  }
}

// Training loop
const replayBuffer = new ReplayBuffer(10000);

for (let step = 0; step < 100000; step++) {
  const experience = collectExperience();
  replayBuffer.push(experience);

  if (step % 4 === 0) {  // Train every 4 steps
    const batch = replayBuffer.sample(32);
    await adapter.train({ data: batch, epochs: 1, batchSize: 32 });
  }
}
```

### Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)

```typescript
// Store experiences with TD error as priority
await adapter.insertPattern({
  // ... standard fields
  confidence: Math.abs(tdError),  // TD error = |Q(s,a) - (r + γ * max Q(s',a'))|
  // ...
});

// Sample high-priority experiences more frequently
const highPriority = await adapter.retrieveWithReasoning(queryEmbedding, {
  domain: 'task-domain',
  k: 32,
  minConfidence: 0.5,  // Higher TD error = higher confidence
});
```

### Multi-Agent Federated Training

```typescript
// Multiple agents share learning
const agents = [agent1, agent2, agent3, agent4];

// Each agent collects experiences
for (const agent of agents) {
  const experience = await agent.collectExperience();

  await adapter.insertPattern({
    domain: `multi-agent/${agent.id}`,
    pattern_data: JSON.stringify({ embedding: ..., pattern: experience }),
    // ...
  });
}

// Train shared model on aggregated experiences
await adapter.train({
  epochs: 50,
  batchSize: 64,
});

// All agents benefit from shared knowledge
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Training (500x Faster)

```typescript
// Collect large batch before training
const BATCH_SIZE = 1000;
const experiences = [];

for (let i = 0; i < BATCH_SIZE; i++) {
  experiences.push(collectExperience());
}

// Batch insert
for (const exp of experiences) {
  await adapter.insertPattern({ /* ... */ });
}

// Train on batch
await adapter.train({
  epochs: 10,
  batchSize: 128,  // Larger batch = faster training
});
```

### Incremental Learning (Online Training)

```typescript
// Train incrementally as new data arrives
setInterval(async () => {
  const newExperiences = getNewExperiences();

  if (newExperiences.length > 100) {
    console.log(`Training on ${newExperiences.length} new experiences...`);

    const metrics = await adapter.train({
      epochs: 5,
      batchSize: 32,
    });

    console.log('Incremental Training Loss:', metrics.loss);
  }
}, 60000);  // Every minute
```

## Integration with Reasoning Agents

Combine RL with reasoning for enhanced performance:

```typescript
// Train RL model
await adapter.train({ epochs: 50, batchSize: 32 });

// Use reasoning agents for richer inference
const result = await adapter.retrieveWithReasoning(queryEmbedding, {
  domain: 'decision-making',
  k: 10,
  useMMR: true,              // Maximal Marginal Relevance (diverse experiences)
  synthesizeContext: true,    // Rich context synthesis
  optimizeMemory: true,       // Consolidate patterns, reduce redundancy
});

// Decision = Learned policy + Reasoning
const learnedAction = result.memories[0].pattern.action;
const reasoningContext = result.context;
const confidence = result.memories[0].similarity;

console.log('Decision:', {
  action: learnedAction,
  confidence: confidence,
  reasoning: reasoningContext
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Training Loss Not Converging

**Solution**: Reduce learning rate or increase batch size
```typescript
await adapter.train({
  epochs: 100,
  batchSize: 64,        // Increase batch size
  learningRate: 0.0001, // Reduce learning rate
});
```

### Issue: Overfitting to Training Data

**Solution**: Use validation split and memory optimization
```typescript
await adapter.train({
  epochs: 50,
  batchSize: 64,
  validationSplit: 0.2,  // 20% validation
});

await adapter.retrieveWithReasoning(queryEmbedding, {
  optimizeMemory: true,  // Consolidate patterns
});
```

### Issue: Slow Training Performance

**Solution**: Enable WASM acceleration and quantization
```bash
# Use binary quantization for 32x speed boost
# Automatically enabled in agentic-flow
```

```typescript
// Batch operations for efficiency
const BATCH_SIZE = 128;  // Larger batches = faster
await adapter.train({ batchSize: BATCH_SIZE });
```

### Issue: Poor Exploration

**Solution**: Adjust epsilon (exploration rate)
```json
{
  "epsilon": 0.2,         // Increase exploration
  "epsilon_decay": 0.995  // Slower decay
}
```
