## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local development without cloud infrastructure needs
- Simple scripts that do not require sandboxed execution
- Operations without distributed computing requirements
- Tasks that can run on single-machine environments

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] API response time: <200ms for sandbox creation [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Deployment success rate: >99% [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Sandbox startup time: <5s [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Network latency: <50ms between sandboxes [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Resource utilization: <80% CPU/memory per sandbox [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Uptime: >99.9% for production deployments [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: Flow Nexus API has request limits; implement queuing and backoff
- **Authentication Failures**: Validate API tokens before operations; refresh expired tokens
- **Network Issues**: Retry failed requests with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Monitor sandbox/compute quotas; alert before limits
- **Sandbox Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeout values; clean up orphaned sandboxes
- **Deployment Failures**: Implement rollback strategies; maintain previous working state

## Guardrails & Safety
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: expose API keys or authentication tokens in code or logs [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate responses from Flow Nexus API before processing [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: implement timeout limits for long-running operations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: trust user input for sandbox commands without validation [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: monitor resource usage to prevent runaway processes [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: clean up sandboxes and resources after task completion [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify platform health: Check Flow Nexus status endpoint before operations
- Validate deployments: Test sandbox connectivity and functionality
- Monitor costs: Track compute usage and spending against budgets
- Test failure scenarios: Simulate network failures, timeouts, auth errors
- Benchmark performance: Compare actual vs expected latency/throughput

Deploy, train, and manage neural networks in distributed E2B sandbox environments. Train custom models with multiple architectures (feedforward, LSTM, GAN, transformer) or use pre-built templates from the marketplace.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Add Flow Nexus MCP server
claude mcp add flow-nexus npx flow-nexus@latest mcp start

# Register and login
npx flow-nexus@latest register
npx flow-nexus@latest login
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Single-Node Neural Training

Train neural networks with custom architectures and configurations.

**Available Architectures:**
- `feedforward` - Standard fully-connected networks
- `lstm` - Long Short-Term Memory for sequences
- `gan` - Generative Adversarial Networks
- `autoencoder` - Dimensionality reduction
- `transformer` - Attention-based models

**Training Tiers:**
- `nano` - Minimal resources (fast, limited)
- `mini` - Small models
- `small` - Standard models
- `medium` - Complex models
- `large` - Large-scale training

#### Example: Train Custom Classifier

```javascript
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_train({
  config: {
    architecture: {
      type: "feedforward",
      layers: [
        { type: "dense", units: 2
