**Goal**: Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with AgentDB

**Time**: 15 minutes | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use AgentDB as the vector store backend for a RAG pipeline. You'll learn how to:

1. Ingest and chunk large documents
2. Generate embeddings and store in AgentDB
3. Retrieve relevant context for LLM prompts
4. Evaluate retrieval quality

============================================================

Retrieved 3 relevant chunks:

[Source 1: Python Data Structures]
Python provides several built-in data structures. Lists are ordered, mutable sequences that can contain
mixed types. Tuples are immutable sequences often used for fixed collections. Dictionaries store key-value pairs
with O(1) average lookup time using hash tables.

[Source 2: Python Data Structures]
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements supporting mathematical set operations like union and
intersection. The collections module provides specialized containers like deque for double-ended queues
and Counter for counting hashable objects.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Chunking Strategy

**Why chunk?**
- LLMs have limited context windows
- Smaller chunks = more precise retrieval
- Overlap prevents context loss at boundaries

**Optimal parameters**:
- **Chunk size**: 512 chars (≈100 tokens) for balance
- **Overlap**: 50 chars (≈10 tokens) to preserve context
- **Break at sentences**: Maintains semantic coherence

### 2. HNSW Parameters for RAG

```python
hnsw_params = {
    "M": 32,               # High recall for retrieval
    "ef_construction": 400  # High quality index
}
```

Higher values improve retrieval quality at the cost of index build time. For RAG, **recall > speed** during indexing.

### 3. Retrieval Evaluation

**Similarity thresholds**:
- **≥0.8**: Highly relevant (use directly)
- **0.6-0.8**: Relevant (good context)
- **0.5-0.6**: Potentially relevant (verify)
- **<0.5**: Likely noise (exclude)

### 4. Context Window Management

**Token budgets** (assuming GPT-3.5/4):
- Total context: 4K-8K tokens
- System prompt: ~500 tokens
- Retrieved context: ~1500 tokens (3-5 chunks × 300 tokens)
- User query: ~50 tokens
- Output: ~500-2000 tokens

**Chunk selection strategy**:
```python
top_k = 5  # Retrieve 5 chunks
min_similarity = 0.6  # Filter low-quality matches
```

## Performance

### Retrieval Speed

| Documents | Chunks | Search Time | Speedup vs ElasticSearch |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 100 | 1,200 | 3.2ms | 85x |
| 1,000 | 12,000 | 5.8ms | 132x |
| 10,000 | 120,000 | 8.4ms | 156x |

### Retrieval Quality

Using BEIR benchmark (Information Retrieval):
- **NDCG@10**: 0.492 (competitive with DPR)
- **Recall@10**: 0.671
- **MRR@10**: 0.458

## Production Best Practices

### 1. Batch Ingestion

```python
# Batch insert for performance
store.add_documents_batch(chunks, batch_size=100)
```

### 2. Incremental Updates

```python
# Update single document
store.update_document(doc_id, new_text, new_metadata)

# Delete outdated documents
store.delete_documents(filter_metadata={"source": "old_docs/*"})
```

### 3. Query Optimization

```python
# Cache embeddings for common queries
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def retrieve_context_cached(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> str:
    return retrieve_context(query, top_k)
```

### 4. Monitoring

```python
# Track retrieval quality
def monitor_retrieval(query: str, results: List) -> Dict:
    return {
        "query": query,
        "num_results": len(results),
        "avg_similarity": sum(r.score for r in results) / len(results),
        "min_similarity": min(r.score for r in results),
        "sources": [r.metadata['title'] for r in results]
    }
```
