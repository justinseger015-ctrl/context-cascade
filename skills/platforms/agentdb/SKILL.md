## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local-only operations with no vector search needs
- Simple key-value storage without semantic similarity
- Real-time streaming data without persistence requirements
- Operations that do not require embedding-based retrieval

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] Vector search query latency: <10ms for 99th percentile [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Embedding generation: <100ms per document [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Index build time: <1s per 1000 vectors [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Recall@10: >0.95 for similar documents [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Database connection success rate: >99.9% [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Memory footprint: <2GB for 1M vectors with quantization [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: AgentDB local instances have no rate limits; cloud deployments may vary
- **Connection Failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Index Corruption**: Maintain backup indices; rebuild from source if corrupted
- **Memory Overflow**: Use quantization (4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce memory by 4-32x
- **Stale Embeddings**: Implement TTL-based refresh for dynamic content
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Validate embedding dimensions (384 for sentence-transformers) before insertion

## Guardrails & Safety
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: expose database connection strings in logs or error messages [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate vector dimensions before insertion [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: sanitize metadata to prevent injection attacks [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: store PII in vector metadata without encryption [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: implement access control for multi-tenant deployments [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate search results before returning to users [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify database health: Check connection status and index integrity
- Validate search quality: Measure recall/precision on test queries
- Monitor performance: Track query latency, throughput, and memory usage
- Test failure recovery: Simulate connection drops and index corruption
- Benchmark improvements: Compare against baseline metrics (e.g., 150x speedup claim)


# AgentDB - Vector Search & Semantic Memory

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)

Ultra-fast vector database for AI agent memory, RAG systems, and semantic search applications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), building semantic search engines, creating persistent agent memory systems, or optimizing vector similarity searches for production workloads.

## Core Capabilities

### Vector Search
- 150x faster than traditional databases
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing
- 384-dimensional sentence embeddings
- Sub-millisecond query latency

### Semantic Memory
- Persistent cross-session storage
- Automatic embedding generation
- Similarity-based retrieval
- Metadata filtering and ranking

### Memory Patterns
- Short-term: Recent context (1-100 items)
- Long-term: Persistent knowledge (unlimited)
- Episodic: Timestamped experiences
- Semantic: Concept relationships

## Process

1. **Initialize vector store**
   - Configure embedding model (sentence-transformers)
   - Set up HNSW index parameters
   - Define metadata schema
   - Allocate storage backend

2. **Store information**
   - Generate embeddings automatically
