## Overview

This SOP provides a systematic workflow for training and deploying neural networks using Flow Nexus platform with distributed E2B sandboxes. It covers architecture selection, distributed training, validation, and production deployment.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Flow Nexus MCP server installed
- Basic understanding of neural network architectures
- Authentication credentials (if using cloud features)

**Optional:**
- E2B account for cloud sandboxes
- GPU resources for training
- Pre-trained model weights

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check Flow Nexus availability
npx flow-nexus@latest --version

# Verify MCP connection
claude mcp list | grep flow-nexus
```

## Agent Responsibilities

### ml-developer (Primary Model Architect)
**Role:** Design neural network architecture, select hyperparameters, optimize model performance

**Expertise:**
- Neural network architectures (Transformer, CNN, RNN, GAN, etc.)
- Training optimization and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and validation strategies
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning

**Output:** Model architecture design, training configuration, performance analysis

### flow-nexus-neural (Platform Coordinator)
**Role:** Coordinate distributed training across cloud infrastructure, manage resources

**Expertise:**
- Flow Nexus platform APIs and capabilities
- Distributed training coordination
- E2B sandbox management
- Resource optimization

**Output:** Training orchestration, resource allocation, deployment configuration

### cicd-engineer (Deployment Specialist)
**Role:** Deploy trained models to production, setup monitoring and scaling

**Expertise:**
- Model serving infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and observability

**Output:** Deployment scripts, monitoring dashboards, production configuration

## Phase 1: Setup Flow Nexus

**Objective:** Authenticate with Flow Nexus platform and initialize neural training environment

**Evidence-Based Validation:**
- Authentication token obtained and verified
- MCP tools responding correctly
- Training environment initialized

**ml-developer Actions:**
```bash
# Pre-task coordination hook
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Setup Flow Nexus for neural training"

# Restore session context
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-restore --session-id "neural-training-$(date +%s)"
```

**flow-nexus-neural Actions:**
```bash
# Check authentication status
mcp__flow-nexus__auth_status { "detailed": true }

# If not authenticated, register/login
# mcp__flow-nexus__user_register { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secure_pass" }
# mcp__flow-nexus__user_login { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "secure_pass" }

# Initialize neural training cluster
mcp__flow-nexus__neural_cluster_init {
  "name": "neural-training-cluster",
  "architecture": "transformer",
  "topology": "mesh",
  "daaEnabled": true,
  "wasmOptimization": true,
  "consensus": "proof-of-learning"
}
