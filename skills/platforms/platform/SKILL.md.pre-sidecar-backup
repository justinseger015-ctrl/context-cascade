# Platform

## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.



Central hub for Flow Nexus platform services and cloud AI capabilities.

## Phase 0: Expertise Loading

```yaml
expertise_check:
  domain: platform
  file: .claude/expertise/platform.yaml

  if_exists:
    - Load platform configurations
    - Load API patterns
    - Apply service quotas

  if_not_exists:
    - Flag discovery mode
    - Document patterns learned
```

## When to Use This Skill

Use platform when:
- Training neural networks in cloud sandboxes
- Deploying AI swarms to cloud
- Managing Flow Nexus platform services
- Setting up platform authentication
- Integrating payment systems

## Sub-Skills

| Skill | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| flow-nexus-neural | Neural network training |
| flow-nexus-platform | Platform management |
| flow-nexus-swarm | Cloud swarm deployment |

## Routing Logic

```yaml
routing:
  if "neural" or "training" or "ml":
    route_to: flow-nexus-neural
  if "swarm" or "deploy":
    route_to: flow-nexus-swarm
  if "auth" or "payment" or "sandbox":
    route_to: flow-nexus-platform
  default:
    route_to: flow-nexus-platform
```

## MCP Requirements

- **claude-flow**: Platform coordination
- **memory-mcp**: State management

## Recursive Improvement Integration (v2.1)

### Eval Harness Integration

```yaml
benchmark: platform-benchmark-v1
  tests:
    - plat-001: Platform routing
    - plat-002: Service availability
  minimum_scores:
    routing_accuracy: 0.90
    service_uptime: 0.99
```

### Memory Namespace

```yaml
namespaces:
  - platform/services/{id}: Service configs
  - platform/metrics: Performance tracking
  - improvement/audits/platform: Skill audits
```

### Uncertainty Handling

```yaml
confidence_check:
  if confidence >= 0.8:
    - Route to appropriate service
  if confidence 0.5-0.8:
    - Present service options
  if confidence < 0.5:
    - Ask clarifying questions
```

### Cross-Skill Coordination

Works with: **flow-nexus-neural**, **flow-nexus-platform**, **flow-nexus-swarm**

## !! SKILL COMPLETION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY) !!

- [ ] **Agent Spawning**: Spawned agent via Task()
- [ ] **Agent Registry Validation**: Agent from registry
- [ ] **TodoWrite Called**: Called with 5+ todos
- [ ] **Work Delegation**: Delegated to agents

**Remember: Skill() -> Task() -> TodoWrite() - ALWAYS**


## Core Principles

1. **Service Abstraction**: Platform services abstract away infrastructure complexity (E2B sandboxes, QUIC synchronization, GPU allocation) behind unified API interfaces, allowing agents to focus on neural network design rather than cloud resource management.

2. **Resource Efficiency Through Routing**: Intelligent routing minimizes unnecessary service hops - neural training requests go directly to flow-nexus-neural, swarm deployments to flow-nexus-swarm, avoiding generic platform overhead when domain-specific paths are available.

3. **Graceful Degradation with Confidence Scoring**: When routing confidence falls below 0.8, the system presents service options rather than making incorrect assumptions, preventing wasted computation on misrouted requests while maintaining user control.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Hardcoding service endpoints | Breaks when Flow Nexus platform migrates infrastructure or updates API versions | Use platform routing logic to resolve services dynamically, load from expertise files |
| Skipping Phase 0 expertise loading | Every request re-discovers service quotas, rate limits, and authentication patterns | Always check .claude/expertise/platform.yaml first, cache service configs in memory-mcp namespace |
| Bypassing confidence checks (forcing routes <0.5) | Routes neural training to generic platform service, wasting GPU time on incorrect setup | Respect confidence thresholds, present options or ask clarifying questions when uncertain |
