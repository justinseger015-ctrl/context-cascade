## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local development without cloud infrastructure needs
- Simple scripts that do not require sandboxed execution
- Operations without distributed computing requirements
- Tasks that can run on single-machine environments

## Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] API response time: <200ms for sandbox creation [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Deployment success rate: >99% [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Sandbox startup time: <5s [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Network latency: <50ms between sandboxes [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Resource utilization: <80% CPU/memory per sandbox [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] Uptime: >99.9% for production deployments [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: Flow Nexus API has request limits; implement queuing and backoff
- **Authentication Failures**: Validate API tokens before operations; refresh expired tokens
- **Network Issues**: Retry failed requests with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Monitor sandbox/compute quotas; alert before limits
- **Sandbox Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeout values; clean up orphaned sandboxes
- **Deployment Failures**: Implement rollback strategies; maintain previous working state

## Guardrails & Safety
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: expose API keys or authentication tokens in code or logs [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: validate responses from Flow Nexus API before processing [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: implement timeout limits for long-running operations [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: trust user input for sandbox commands without validation [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: monitor resource usage to prevent runaway processes [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|neutral] ALWAYS: clean up sandboxes and resources after task completion [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify platform health: Check Flow Nexus status endpoint before operations
- Validate deployments: Test sandbox connectivity and functionality
- Monitor costs: Track compute usage and spending against budgets
- Test failure scenarios: Simulate network failures, timeouts, auth errors
- Benchmark performance: Compare actual vs expected latency/throughput

**Gold Tier Skill**: Comprehensive platform management for Flow Nexus with 4 automation scripts, 3 configuration templates, and comprehensive test suites - covering authentication, sandbox execution, app deployment, credit management, and coding challenges.

## Quick Access

- **Scripts**: `resources/scripts/` - 4 platform automation tools
- **Templates**: `resources/templates/` - 3 configuration templates
- **Tests**: `tests/` - 3 comprehensive test suites
- **Process Diagram**: `flow-nexus-platform-process.dot` - Visual workflow

## Automation Scripts

This skill includes functional automation scripts for streamlined platform operations:

### 1. Authentication Manager (`auth-manager.js`)

Automate user authentication workflows:

```bash
# Register new user
node resources/scripts/auth-manager.js register user@example.com SecurePass123 "John Doe"

# Login
node resources/scripts/auth-manager.js login user@example.com SecurePass123

# Check authentication status
node resources/scripts/auth-manager.js status --detailed

# Update profile
node resources/scripts/auth-manager.js update-profile user123 bio="AI Developer" github_username=johndoe

# Upgrade ti
