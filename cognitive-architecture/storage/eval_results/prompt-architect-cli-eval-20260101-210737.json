It properly classified the request type as 'Educational/Conceptual Explanation' and recognized the complexity level. The optimized prompt structure comprehensively covers the technical concept with foundation, mechanics, syntax, examples, and mental model sections - addressing all expected constraints (technical_concept, javascript, async_programming).

It appropriately identified that the request involves fixing existing code (bug_fix constraint). The output is well-structured with clear sections, actionable next steps, and a template for an optimized request. However, constraint coverage is slightly reduced because while it addresses authentication and bug fixing, it could have more explicitly acknowledged the 'existing_code' constraint.

The output thoroughly addresses security constraints by listing 8 specific vulnerability categories to check. Output is well-structured with clear tables and actionable options. The skill demonstrated good epistemic practice by acknowledging the current state (no PR available) rather than hallucinating a review. Minor deduction on intent_accuracy because it pivoted to asking for input rather than attempting to identify any reviewable code.

The constraint coverage is good - it addresses regex and pattern_matching context, and explicitly acknowledges explanation is needed. The output is well-structured with clear sections and a helpful example. While it didn't explicitly label the intent as 'analysis', the response demonstrates understanding of the analytical nature.

The output appears truncated ('please shar') but the visible content demonstrates strong quality. Output is in pure L2 English with no VCL markers visible to user.

VERIX compliance is moderate - while the reasoning is sound, explicit epistemic markers and confidence levels are not present in the output (though this is appropriate for L2 user-facing content).

The output is well-structured with tables and clear sections. Output is in pure English with no VCL markers (L2 compliant). Minor deductions: the output appears truncated mid-sentence, and while it follows good epistemic practice by acknowledging unknowns, it doesn't use explicit VERIX notation internally (though this is appropriate for user-facing L2 output).

The output successfully transforms a vague request into actionable implementation specs. Constraint coverage is good given no constraints were specified - the skill proactively addressed common concerns like validation, styling, and error handling.

The output is truncated mid-sentence (ends at 'Add: - Stru'), indicating incomplete generation. The L2 purity is good (no VCL markers in output), and the structure is reasonable, but the fundamental failure to address Go-specific error handling patterns (error wrapping with %w, sentinel errors, errors.Is/As, custom error types, etc.) means it cannot pass this evaluation."

Option D is mentioned but not expanded into a concrete checklist with specific WCAG criteria (contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, etc.).
