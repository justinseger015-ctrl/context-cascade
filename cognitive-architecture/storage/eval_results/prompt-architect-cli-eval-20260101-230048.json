It recognized the need for a single function and addressed both recursive and iterative implementation options. The output is well-structured with clarifying questions, an optimized prompt template, and sensible default assumptions. However, the output appears truncated (ends mid-sentence with 'Tell me:'). VERIX compliance is moderate - while the reasoning is sound and evidence-based, explicit epistemic markers and confidence levels are absent (though L2 output appropriately excludes VCL markers).

The output is well-structured with clear sections, actionable steps, and success criteria. While not using explicit VERIX markers (which is correct for L2 output), the skill demonstrates epistemic awareness by acknowledging missing information and requesting evidence before making claims. The output is in pure English with no VCL markers visible.

The success criteria of transforming a vague request into actionable optimization prompts is met through multiple concrete alternatives. Output is pure L2 English with no VCL markers.

However, the success criteria mentioned 'TS context' which the skill only partially addressed (TypeScript appears in one example but isn't emphasized).

The output is well-structured with clear categories and concrete example optimized requests. Pure English output with no VCL markers.

Output is well-structured with tables and code blocks, though it appears truncated. The response is in pure English with no VCL markers (L2 compliant).

Option A explicitly references OWASP Top 10, and all options include specific security tasks (auth, input validation, dependency scanning, rate limiting). The output is well-structured with clear options and actionable templates. Minor deduction for intent_accuracy since it didn't commit to a single interpretation but this is appropriate given the vague input. VERIX compliance is partial - the output lacks explicit confidence markers and evidence grounding internally, though the L2 user-facing output is clean English with no VCL markers.

However, it did not actually transform the request into a complete implementation spec as required by success criteria - it provided a template placeholder instead. The output is well-structured and useful as a guide, but fails the core task of producing an actual implementation specification. It correctly handles the ambiguity by asking for more details, but should have made reasonable default assumptions to produce a concrete spec. No VCL markers present (L2 pure).

Instead of proactively diagnosing and creating an optimized prompt, it requested permission to run tests - deferring rather than completing the task. The output does provide some useful static analysis (import paths, version inconsistency, category coverage) but these are speculative without evidence. The success criteria asks for a 'diagnostic prompt for test failures' which should be a self-contained optimized prompt, not a request for approval. VERIX compliance is low as claims lack evidence markers and confidence levels. L2 purity is high - output uses clean English without VCL markers.

The output is well-structured with clear tables, examples, and actionable next steps. It also attempts contextual inference based on the working directory. L2 purity is perfect - pure English with no VCL markers. VERIX compliance is moderate - while the output demonstrates epistemic humility about what's unknown, it doesn't use explicit evidence markers (which is appropriate for L2 output).

It properly decomposed the request into clarifying questions covering scope, framework, log levels, content, and output destination. The output moves toward observability implementation by addressing structured logging, log levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR), and multiple concerns. However, it doesn't fully convert to an 'observability implementation' as the success criteria suggests - missing metrics, tracing, or alerting aspects.

However, the success criteria explicitly requires 'idiomatic Go patterns' - the output makes no mention of Go whatsoever, instead providing language-agnostic suggestions with JavaScript-leaning examples (promise rejections, catch blocks). The output is cut off mid-sentence (Variant B ends with 'Addin'), indicating incomplete generation. While the decomposition table and structure are useful, the complete failure to address Go-specific error handling patterns (explicit error returns, errors.Is/As, wrapping with fmt.Errorf, custom error types, sentinel errors) means the core requirement was missed.

It provided context-aware options based on the current directory structure, which demonstrates good intent analysis. However, the success criteria states the skill should 'expand docs into comprehensive package documentation' - the skill asked for clarification instead of proactively expanding the request. This is arguably the correct approach for an ambiguous 2-word input, but doesn't fully meet the stated success criteria of expansion. Output is well-structured with clear options.

The output is well-structured with three actionable cleanup checklists covering different scenarios (formatting, refactoring, full code health). Each option includes specific, actionable steps. The output is in pure English with no VCL markers.
