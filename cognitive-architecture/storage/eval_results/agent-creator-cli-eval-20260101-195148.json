      "reasoning": "The skill correctly understood the intent to create a code review agent and produced a reasonable summary of what such an agent would contain. However, the success criteria explicitly requires 'valid agent definition with proper frontmatter' - the output provides a description of the agent but does not show the actual YAML frontmatter or complete agent definition file content. It describes features but doesn't deliver the actual artifact. The output is well-structured and in pure English (L2 compliant), but lacks VERIX epistemic markers for internal documentation. Partial pass because the conceptual work is solid, but the deliverable format doesn't fully meet the 'proper frontmatter' requirement."

      "reasoning": "The skill correctly created a documentation generation agent with the 'delivery' category as specified in success criteria. The output is well-structured with clear tables showing attributes, capabilities, and execution protocol. The agent definition covers comprehensive documentation types (API docs, READMEs, architecture docs, code comments, user guides, changelogs) which exceeds basic requirements. L2 purity is perfect - pure English with no VCL markers. Minor deductions: VERIX compliance could include more explicit confidence levels on claims about agent capabilities, and constraint coverage loses points only because no specific constraints were provided to evaluate against."
