It correctly recognized the request as a code_generation intent while flagging the 'Monolith Anti-Pattern' - explicitly noting that 6+ distinct domains in one function violates separation of concerns. The skill also identified the unbounded scope issue with 'does everything'. Constraints were well-addressed with clear categorization (HARD/SOFT/INFERRED) and identification of missing requirements (language, auth method, framework, etc.).

It correctly identified the request as problematic due to missing context, vague directives, and lack of source reference. The output is well-structured with clear sections for observations, anti-patterns detected, and an optimized prompt template. However, intent_accuracy is slightly reduced because it labeled the primary intent as 'code_generation' when the real intent was to test anti-pattern detection. The output is nearly pure L2 English with no VCL markers visible to users, though the structured format with bullet points and code blocks is appropriate for this context. VERIX compliance is moderate - while evidence-based reasoning is present, explicit epistemic markers are absent (which is correct for L2 output but reduces VERIX scoring).

It accurately detected that wrapping 'everything' in try-catch is poor practice, explaining why (swallows errors, hides bugs, violates error-handling principles). The output is well-structured with clear sections, tables, and actionable alternatives. However, the output appears truncated (cuts off mid-sentence at 'Option A - If you want graceful e'), reducing output quality. VERIX compliance is moderate - while the analysis is evidence-based and epistemic reasoning is implicit, there are no explicit confidence markers or evidence grounding as required by L1 internal standards.

It recognized the 'tactical vs strategic' tension and the self-aware parenthetical acknowledgment. The constraint table effectively captured both explicit and inferred constraints. Output quality is reduced because it appears truncated mid-sentence ('What doe').

The output is well-structured with clear sections for intent, observations, constraints, and anti-patterns. It meets the success criteria of flagging global state as an architectural anti-pattern. Minor deductions: output appears truncated (cuts off mid-sentence), VERIX epistemic markers are absent (though this improves L2 purity), and constraint coverage could have explicitly mentioned testability/maintainability consequences.

The skill extracted both explicit constraints (simplicity) and inferred important missing constraints (codebase scope, environment context, sensitive values). The 'Issues Identified' section explicitly calls out the anti-pattern with specific concerns: security risk, maintainability problems, and environment inflexibility. Output is well-structured with clear sections. The response is in pure English with no VCL markers visible to the user.

It effectively addressed the success criteria of flagging test skipping as a quality risk. The output is well-structured with clear tables and sections, though it appears truncated. VERIX compliance is moderate - while the analysis demonstrates epistemic care (noting assumptions 'require validation'), it lacks explicit VERIX markers and confidence levels.

It immediately flagged the plain text password storage as unacceptable, addressed the 'encrypt later' fallacy, and correctly distinguished between encryption and hashing. The output is well-structured with clear sections explaining the security assessment. Success criteria explicitly required 'immediately flags as critical security issue' which was fully met.

Output is mostly pure English (L2) with minimal formatting markers. The output was truncated mid-sentence which slightly reduces quality.

It extracted both hard constraints (10TB throughput, 50ms latency) and intelligently inferred additional constraints that would realistically apply. The skill demonstrated strong analytical capability by identifying critical ambiguities in the original prompt\u00e2\u20ac\u201dspecifically the missing pipeline reference, undefined latency percentile, unclear optimization dimensions, and unknown current state. The output is well-structured with clear sections for intent analysis, constraint extraction, and ambiguity detection. While it doesn't use explicit VERIX markers (which is appropriate for L2 output), the epistemic stance is somewhat implicit rather than explicitly grounded. The output is in pure English without VCL markers, maintaining L2 purity.

It appropriately inferred soft constraints and identified critical gaps requiring clarification (cloud provider, timeline, team expertise, compliance requirements). However, the output appears truncated mid-sentence ('constrai'), which significantly impacts output_quality. The skill demonstrates good analytical depth by questioning scope ambiguity and architecture definitions. VERIX compliance is low because the output lacks proper epistemic markers, confidence levels, and evidence grounding that the VERIX specification requires. L2 purity is high as the output uses plain English without VCL markers in the user-facing content. The analysis provides a safe foundation for migration strategy by identifying risks and unknowns, meeting the success criteria despite the incomplete output."

It recognized the meta-level nature of the request and proactively offered to provide both principles and a concrete template. The output is well-structured with clear headers, numbered principles, and practical examples (good vs bad prompts). However, the output appears truncated mid-sentence ('All three models r'), which limits the completeness of constraint coverage and output quality scores. The response uses pure L2 English with no VCL markers visible to user. VERIX compliance is good - claims are grounded in observable model behavior differences without overreaching certainty.

      "reasoning": "The skill correctly identified the core intent (collaborative editor with conflict resolution) and acknowledged the 'Google Docs' reference as a UX benchmark. However, the output appears to be a confidence assessment rather than an actual optimized prompt or implementation plan. The success criteria asks for addressing distributed systems challenges, and while the output mentions OT/CRDT algorithms, it doesn't deeply explore networking, consistency models, presence systems, or operational transformation specifics. The output contains VCL-style markers like bracketed confidence values and 'Evidence Grounding' sections that bleed L1 notation into what should be L2 pure output. Constraint coverage is moderate as many constraints are self-admittedly inferred rather than explicitly addressed. The structure is reasonable but incomplete for what a 'complex_optimization' category task requires."

It appropriately recognized regulatory implications and asked clarifying questions about the specific framework and audience. However, the output shown is incomplete - we only see the 'Next Step' portion rather than the full optimized prompt or recommendation system design. Constraint coverage is reasonable given it identified compliance as key but didn't enumerate specific technical constraints (data format, latency, scale). VERIX compliance is moderate - the output lacks explicit epistemic markers and confidence levels that would be expected for internal reasoning. L2 purity is high as the user-facing output is in natural English without VCL markers. The proactive clarification before proceeding demonstrates good practice for complex optimization tasks."

It applied skepticism appropriate for a reported claim. However, verix_compliance is reduced because the output doesn't explicitly apply the report confidence ceiling (0.70) as specified in success criteria - it identifies the problem but doesn't quantify confidence bounds. L2_purity is lower because the output contains structural markers like [HARD], [SOFT], [INFER] which are VCL-style notation that should not appear in user-facing output.

However, the success criteria specifically required applying an inference ceiling of 0.70 - the output should have explicitly stated that any diagnosis without the actual bug description would be limited to inference confidence of 0.70 or below. The skill implicitly practiced epistemic humility by refusing to guess, but did not explicitly demonstrate VERIX-style confidence calibration or mention the inference ceiling. The output is well-structured, provides actionable guidance with a bug report template, and maintains pure L2 English throughout.

The output is well-structured with clear sections for intent analysis, constraints, issues, and optimized prompts.

The output is well-structured with clear sections.
