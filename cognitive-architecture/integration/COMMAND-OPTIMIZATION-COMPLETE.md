## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Core Cognitive Commands (6)
Commands: `/mode`, `/eval`, `/optimize`, `/pareto`, `/frame`, `/verix`

- Baseline VERIX: 4.4%
- Optimized VERIX: 100%
- **Improvement: +95.6%**

These are the foundation commands that the cognitive architecture depends on. Optimizing them first ensures the optimization loop itself uses VERIX/VERILINGUA.

### Phase 2: Delivery Commands (44)
Groups: essential (10), sparc (25), workflows (9)

Key commands optimized:
- SPARC methodology: `analyzer`, `architect`, `coder`, `tester`, `reviewer`
- Essential: `build-feature`, `deploy-check`, `fix-bug`, `review-pr`
- Workflows: `deployment`, `github-release`, `k8s-deploy`

### Phase 3: Operations Commands (26)
Groups: monitoring (10), memory (8), optimization (8)

Key commands optimized:
- Monitoring: `agent-metrics`, `log-stream`, `swarm-monitor`
- Memory: `memory-export`, `memory-persist`, `memory-search`
- Optimization: `auto-topology`, `resource-optimize`, `parallel-execute`

### Phase 4: Orchestration Commands (14)
Groups: swarm (8), hive-mind (6)

Key commands optimized:
- Swarm: `swarm-init`, `swarm-spawn`, `swarm-status`, `swarm-analysis`
- Hive-Mind: `hive-mind-init`, `hive-mind-consensus`, `hive-mind-metrics`

### Phase 5: Quality Commands (12)
Groups: audit (9), analysis (3)

Key commands optimized:
- Audit: `functionality-audit`, `security-audit`, `theater-detect`
- Analysis: `bottleneck-detect`, `performance-report`, `token-efficiency`

### Phase 6: Foundry Commands (9)
Groups: agent (6), expertise (3)

Key commands optimized:
- Agent: `agent-benchmark`, `agent-health-check`, `agent-rca`
- Expertise: `expertise-create`, `expertise-validate`, `expertise-challenge`

### Phase 7: Research + Security Commands (16)
Groups: research (6), reverse-eng (10)

Key commands optimized:
- Research: `literature-review`, `experiment-design`, `data-analysis`
- Security: `decompile`, `malware-sandbox`, `network-traffic`

## Optimization Patterns Applied

### VERIX Enhancement Pattern
```
BEFORE (Baseline):
  task_accuracy: 0.82
  token_efficiency: 0.75

AFTER (Optimized):
  [assert|neutral] task_accuracy: 0.82 [ground:rubric-grader] [conf:0.92] [state:verified]
  [assert|neutral] token_efficiency: 0.75 [ground:token-counter] [conf:0.98] [state:verified]
```

### VERILINGUA Frame Activation Pattern
```
BEFORE (Baseline):
  Current Mode: balanced
  Frames: evidential, aspectual

AFTER (Optimized):
  ## Kanitsal Cerceve (Evidential Frame Activation)
  Kaynak dogrulama modu etkin.

  [assert|neutral] Current Mode: balanced [ground:mode-registry] [conf:0.95]
  [assert|neutral] Active frames: evidential, aspectual [ground:config.yaml] [conf:0.98]
```

## GlobalMOO Pareto Points Generated

Each phase submitted outcomes to GlobalMOO:
- 7 phases x 2 iterations = 14 Pareto points added
- All points show 100% VERIX compliance (optimized)
- Frame alignment averaging 69% across all commands

## Next Steps: Level 1-3 Cascade

### Level 1: Agents (211)
Apply same optimization pattern to agent system prompts:
- Add VERIX protocol sections
- Add frame activation in identity
- Add epistemic markers to capabilities

### Level 2: Skills (196)
Apply to skill SOPs:
- VERIX-annotate all instructions
- Add frame selection based on skill domain
- Track quality metrics per skill

### Level 3: Playbooks (30)
Apply to playbook orchestration:
- Ensure frame consistency across phases
- VERIX-annotate phase transitions
- Track optimization deltas end-to-end

## Conclusion

Level 0 (Commands) optimization complete:
- **127 commands** optimized
- **100% VERIX compliance** achieved
- **69% frame alignment** achieved
- **All phases converged** within 2 iterations
- **Ralph Wiggum loop** successfully enforced convergence

The cognitive architecture can now cascade optimization to the next level (Agents).
