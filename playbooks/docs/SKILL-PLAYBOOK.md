## Orchestrated Skill Sequences for Optimal Workflows

**Version**: 1.1.0
**Updated**: 2025-12-19
**Changelog**: Added cognitive lensing framework to three-loop playbook

---

## Overview

The **Skill Playbook** system defines optimized sequences of skills for different types of tasks. Instead of manually selecting skills, the system uses:

1. **intent-analyzer** - Analyzes user request and determines intent
2. **prompt-architect** - Improves the request for clarity
3. **orchestration-router** - Selects the right playbook
4. **Skill Sequence** - Executes coordinated skill chain

This creates a **zero-decision paralysis** workflow where every request follows a proven path.

---

### Delivery Playbook 2: Complex Feature (Three-Loop)

**When**: Complex feature, multiple components, high stakes

**Metadata**:
```yaml
playbook_id: three-loop-research-to-implementation
version: 1.1.0
cognitive_frame:
  frames:
    - type: evidential
      language: Turkish
      purpose: "Track evidence from research to implementation"
      method: "Kanitsal Zincir (Evidential Chain)"
    - type: aspectual
      language: Russian
      purpose: "Manage workflow state transitions"
      method: "Aspektual'noye Otslezhivaniye (State Tracking)"
    - type: hierarchical
      language: Japanese
      purpose: "Organize phases and tasks"
      method: "Keigo Wakugumi (Work Hierarchy)"
```

**Sequence**:
```yaml
1. intent-analyzer → Deep requirements analysis
2. prompt-architect → Comprehensive spec optimization
3. orchestration-router → Route to three-loop playbook
4. research-driven-planning → Loop 1 (5x pre-mortem, risk mitigation)
5. parallel-swarm-implementation → Loop 2 (6-agent parallel execution)
6. theater-detection-audit → Byzantine consensus validation
7. cicd-intelligent-recovery → Loop 3 (automated testing + fixes)
8. production-readiness → Final deployment validation
```

---

## Cognitive Frame Activation

### Kanitsal Zincir (Evidential Chain - Turkish)

Every decision requires citation from research through to code:

```
Research Finding [EVIDENCE] → Design Decision [RATIONALE] → Implementation Choice [CODE]
          ↓                           ↓                              ↓
    Literature review          Technology selection           Actual implementation
    Best practices docs        Architecture patterns          Test validation
    Pre-mortem analysis        Risk mitigation plan           Production deployment
```

**Enforcement**:
- LOOP 1 (Research): Document all sources (papers, docs, APIs)
- LOOP 2 (Implementation): Every pattern MUST cite design decision
- LOOP 3 (Validation): Tests MUST trace back to requirements

**Example**:
```
RESEARCH: "Stripe recommends idempotency keys for payment retry" [CITE: Stripe Docs]
   ↓
DESIGN: "Use Redis to store idempotency keys with 24hr TTL" [RATIONALE: Prevent duplicate charges]
   ↓
CODE: implements RedisIdempotencyStore with 86400s expiry [VALIDATED: Unit tests pass]
```

---

### Aspektual'noye Otslezhivaniye (State Tracking - Russian)

Track completion state for each phase using aspectual markers:

```
LOOP 1: RESEARCH-DRIVEN PLANNING
  - Literature review:        [SV] (Completed - Sovershenny Vid)
  - Pre-mortem cycles:        [NSV] (In-progress - Nesovershenny Vid)
  - Technology selection:     [BLOCKED] (Waiting on stakeholder)
  - Risk mitigation plan:     [NSV]

LOOP 2: PARALLEL SWARM IMPLEMENTATION
  - Backend API:              [NSV] (Implementation ongoing)
  - Frontend components:      [NSV] (Implementation ongoing)
  - Database schema:          [SV] (Migration complete)
  - Integration tests:        [PENDING]

LOOP 3: CI/CD RECOVERY
  - Test execution:           [NSV] (Running test suite)
  - Failure analysis:         [PENDING]
  - Auto-repair:              [PENDING]
  - Production deploy:        [PENDING]
```

**State Transitions**:
- `PENDING` → `NSV` (task started)
- `NSV` → `SV` (task completed)
- `NSV` → `BLOCKED` (dependency unmet)
- `BLOCKED` → `NSV` (dependency resolved)

**Checkpoint Gates**:
- Cannot proceed to LOOP 2 until LOOP 1 all [SV]
- Cannot proceed to LOOP 3 until LOOP 2 all [SV]
- Cannot deploy until LOOP 3 all [SV]

## Priority Routing Logic (orchestration-router)

**The orchestration-router skill uses this decision tree:**

### Priority 1: Explicit Workflow Signals

| Signal | Playbook |
|--------|----------|
| "three-loop", "research-driven", "pre-mortem" | Delivery Playbook 2 (Three-Loop) |
| "end-to-end", "ship feature", "complete workflow" | Delivery Playbook 3 (E2E) |
| "deep research", "systematic review", "publish paper" | Research Playbook 2 (Deep SOP) |
| "deploy to production", "release", "launch" | Operations Playbook 1 (Deployment) |

### Priority 2: Complexity Signals

| Agent Count / Complexity | Playbook |
|--------------------------|----------|
| "6+ agents", "complex", "high stakes" | Three-Loop (Delivery 2) |
| "parallel swarm", "multi-agent" | Swarm Orchestration |
| "simple", "quick", "single component" | Simple Feature (Delivery 1) |

### Priority 3: Domain Signals

| Domain Keywords | Playbook |
|-----------------|----------|
| React, Vue, frontend, UI | Specialist Playbook 1 (Frontend) |
| API, backend, database | Specialist Playbook 2 (Backend) |
| ML, neural network, training | Specialist Playbook 3 (ML) |
| CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure | Operations Playbooks |
| security, audit, compliance | Security Playbooks |

### Priority 4: Default Fallback

If no clear signals → **Simple Feature (Delivery 1)** with SPARC methodology

---

## Playbook Execution Flow

```javascript
// Example: User says "Build payment processing with Stripe"

1. intent-analyzer
   → Intent: Complex feature implementation
   → Confidence: 95%
   → Constraints: Payment security, PCI compliance
   → Proceed to prompt optimization

2. prompt-architect
   → Enhanced: "Implement Stripe payment processing with:
      - Secure checkout flow
      - Webhook handling for payment events
      - PCI DSS compliance
      - Test mode + production mode
      - Error handling and retry logic
      - Payment method management"

3. orchestration-router
   → Detected signals: "complex", "payment", "security"
   → Selected: Delivery Playbook 2 (Three-Loop)
   → Rationale: High complexity + security requirements

4. Playbook Execution:
   Loop 1 (research-driven-planning)
     → Research Stripe best practices
     → 5x pre-mortem (payment failures, security risks, etc.)
     → Risk mitigation strategies

   Loop 2 (parallel-swarm-implementation)
     → 6 agents in parallel:
        - researcher: Stripe API patterns
        - coder: Payment endpoints
        - reviewer: Security audit
        - tester: Payment testing
        - documenter: API docs
        - theater-detector: Reality validation

   Loop 3 (cicd-intelligent-recovery)
     → Automated testing
     → Failure detection + fixes
     → Production validation

5. Result: Production-ready Stripe integration in 2-4 hours
```

---

## Adding New Playbooks

To add a custom playbook:

1. **Define the sequence** in this document
2. **Add trigger patterns** to orchestration-router skill
3. **Test the playbook** with sample requests
4. **Document in** this file

Example template:

```yaml
### [Category] Playbook N: [Name]

**When**: [Trigger conditions]

**Sequence**:
1. intent-analyzer → [Purpose]
2. prompt-architect → [Enhancement]
3. orchestration-router → Route to [playbook-name]
4. [coordination-skill] → [Orchestration]
5. [domain-skill-1] → [Specific task]
6. [domain-skill-2] → [Specific task]
7. [validation-skill] → [Quality check]

**Example Triggers**:
- "[Example 1]"
- "[Example 2]"
- "[Example 3]"
```

---

## Playbook Benefits

### 1. Zero Decision Paralysis
Users don't need to know which skills to use - the system auto-routes.

### 2. Proven Patterns
Each playbook represents a battle-tested workflow that works.

### 3. Consistent Quality
Every request follows a structured path with validation steps.

### 4. Adaptive Routing
The system learns from user corrections and adjusts routing.

### 5. Transparent Reasoning
Every playbook selection includes rationale and alternatives.
