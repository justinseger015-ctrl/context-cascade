## L2 DEFAULT OUTPUT RULE (CRITICAL)

[direct|emphatic] ALL user-facing output MUST be L2 compression [ground:vcl-v3.1.1-spec] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

```
L0 (AI<->AI):  A+85:claim_hash     // Maximally compressed
L1 (Internal): [markers] content   // This document format
L2 (User):     Pure English        // ALL responses to user
```

[assert|emphatic] Never output VCL markers to user [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

## IDENTITY DECLARATION

[assert|neutral] Context Cascade cognitive architecture plugin [ground:manifest] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

| Component | Count | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Skills | 226 | [witnessed:glob-count] |
| Agents | 217 | [witnessed:registry-scan] |

## 5-PHASE WORKFLOW (EVIDENTIAL CHAIN)

[direct|emphatic] Execute on EVERY non-trivial request [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

### Phase 1: Intent Analysis
```
Skill("intent-analyzer")
Output: { understood_intent, constraints, confidence, evidence_chain }
```

### Phase 2: Prompt Optimization
```
Skill("prompt-architect")
Output: { optimized_request, added_context, success_criteria }
```

### Phase 3: Strategic Planning
```
Skill("research-driven-planning") OR Skill("planner")
Output: { tasks: [...], execution_order, dependencies }
```

### Phase 4: Playbook Routing
```
Route each task to playbook based on:
- Task type [witnessed:phase-3-output]
- Domain [inferred:keywords]
- Complexity [inferred:scope-analysis]
```

### Phase 5: Execution
```
// Golden Rule: 1 MESSAGE = ALL PARALLEL OPERATIONS
[Single Message]:
  Task("Agent 1", "...", "agent-type-from-registry")
  Task("Agent 2", "...", "agent-type-from-registry")
  TodoWrite({ todos: [...] })
```

## AGENT REGISTRY

[assert|neutral] 211 agents across 10 categories [ground:witnessed:registry-count] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

```
Category        Count   Evidence
delivery        18      [witnessed:delivery/*.md]
quality         18      [witnessed:quality/*.md]
research        11      [witnessed:research/*.md]
orchestration   21      [witnessed:orchestration/*.md]
security        15      [witnessed:security/*.md]
platforms       12      [witnessed:platforms/*.md]
specialists     45      [witnessed:specialists/*.md]
tooling         24      [witnessed:tooling/*.md]
foundry         18      [witnessed:foundry/*.md]
operations      29      [witnessed:operations/*.md]
```

[direct|emphatic] NEVER use agents not in registry [ground:system-policy] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

---

## SKILL INVOCATION PATTERN

[assert|neutral] Skills define SOPs, Tasks execute them [ground:architecture-design] [conf:0.95] [state:confirmed]

```
Pattern: Skill -> Task -> TodoWrite

Skill("skill-name")           // Defines the procedure
  |
  v
Task("Agent", "...", "type")  // Executes via agent
  |
  v
TodoWrite({ todos })          // Tracks progress
```

## VERILINGUA COGNITIVE FRAMES

[assert|neutral] Seven frames force cognitive distinctions [ground:linguistic-research] [conf:0.95] [state:confirmed]

```
FRAME           SOURCE              COGNITIVE FORCE
evidential      Turkish -mis/-di    "How do you know?"
aspectual       Russian aspect      "Complete or ongoing?"
morphological   Arabic roots        "What are the components?"
compositional   German compounds    "Build from primitives"
honorific       Japanese keigo      "Who is the audience?"
classifier      Chinese classifiers "What type/count?"
spatial         Guugu Yimithirr     "Absolute position?"
```

### Evidence Markers (MANDATORY for L1)

```
[witnessed]     - Direct observation (read code, ran test)
[reported:src]  - Secondhand from source (docs, user, API)
[inferred]      - Deduced from evidence (reasoning chain)
[assumed:conf]  - Assumption with confidence level
```

---

## VERIX EPISTEMIC NOTATION

[assert|neutral] Statement encodes epistemic stance [ground:verix-spec] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

### Grammar
```
CLAIM := [illocution|affect] content [ground:source] [conf:X.XX] [state:status]
```

### Confidence Ceilings by EVD Type
```
definition: 0.95    policy: 0.90      observation: 0.95
research: 0.85      report: 0.70      inference: 0.70
```

### Illocution Types
```
assert  - Factual claim     direct  - Instruction
query   - Question          commit  - Promise
express - Attitude
```

### States
```
provisional - May revise    confirmed - Verified
retracted   - Withdrawn
```

## NAMED MODES (MOO-OPTIMIZED)

[assert|neutral] Pareto-optimal configurations [ground:moo-output] [conf:0.92] [state:confirmed]

```
Mode      Accuracy  Efficiency  Primary Frames
audit     0.960     0.763       evidential, aspectual, morphological
speed     0.734     0.950       (minimal frames)
research  0.980     0.824       evidential, honorific, classifier
robust    0.960     0.769       evidential, aspectual, morphological
balanced  0.882     0.928       evidential, spatial
```

## MULTI-MODEL SUBAGENT INVOCATION (CRITICAL)

[direct|emphatic] Codex CLI and Gemini CLI are INSTALLED and READY [ground:witnessed:version-check] [conf:0.99] [state:confirmed]

**Installed CLIs**:
- Codex: v0.66.0 at `/c/Users/17175/AppData/Roaming/npm/codex`
- Gemini: v0.20.2 at `/c/Users/17175/AppData/Roaming/npm/gemini`

### MANDATORY Rules

1. [assert|emphatic] NEVER install or upgrade codex/gemini [ground:already-installed]
2. [assert|emphatic] ALWAYS use login shell: `bash -lc "<command>"` [ground:path-fix]
3. [assert|emphatic] RUN preflight before invoking [ground:verification]:
   ```bash
   bash -lc "command -v codex && codex --version"
   bash -lc "command -v gemini && gemini --version"
   ```
4. [assert|emphatic] If preflight FAILS, STOP and report - DO NOT install [ground:policy]
5. [assert|emphatic] Use PLAIN command names, NOT file paths [ground:portability]

### Invocation Patterns

**Codex (autonomous coding)**:
```bash
bash -lc "codex exec 'your task here'"                    # Basic
bash -lc "codex --full-auto exec 'your task here'"        # Autonomous
bash -lc "codex exec --json 'your task here'"             # JSON output
bash -lc "codex --yolo exec 'your task here'"             # Bypass approvals
```

**Gemini (research/megacontext)**:
```bash
bash -lc "gemini 'your query here'"                       # Basic
bash -lc "gemini --all-files 'analyze architecture'"      # 1M token context
bash -lc "gemini -o json 'your query here'"               # JSON output
```

**Preferred: Use delegate.sh wrapper**:
```bash
./scripts/multi-model/delegate.sh codex "Fix all tests" --full-auto
./scripts/multi-model/delegate.sh gemini "Map architecture" --all-files
```

### Model Strengths

| Task | Route To | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Research (current info) | Gemini | Google Search grounding |
| Large codebase analysis | Gemini | 1M token context |
| Autonomous iteration | Codex | Full-auto/YOLO modes |
| Complex reasoning | Claude | Multi-step logic |
| Critical decisions | LLM Council | Multi-model consensus |

```
Every 3 Days:
1. Load telemetry from memory-mcp
2. Run GlobalMOO (5D exploration)
3. Run PyMOO NSGA-II (14D refinement)
4. Distill named modes
5. Apply to cascade (commands -> agents -> skills -> playbooks)
```
